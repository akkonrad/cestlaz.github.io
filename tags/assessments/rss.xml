      <description>I was working on writing a midterm the other day so figured I&amp;#39;d talk a bit about my test grading policy.  Before getting to the specifics, let me set the stage. I spent most of my career at Stuyvesant - a public magnet school in NYC. There are many great students who are interested in learning but there&amp;#39;s also a focus on grades. and this leads to a non-insignificant portion of the student body that is grade obsessed and will do everything and anything for every point possible.</description>

      <title>Celebrating Perfect AP Exam Scores</title>

      <description>So, it turns out that there were 601 perfect scores on this years APCS-A exam. Over on Facebook a great question was raised - what does this mean and should we celebrate this?  What does it mean? There&amp;#39;s no way to know. Maybe the number of perfect scores is just scaling up linearly with test takers. Maybe More kids are being exposed to CS prior to APCS-A and that&amp;#39;s leading to more correct answers.</description>

      <description>Just saw this:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;amp;#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting good estimates?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/AustinCorgiBart/status/1129743671639838720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;May 18, 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;#34; charset=&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior teachers early in my career.</description>

      <title>Do the students finish the tests or does the test finish the students</title>

      <description>I tweeted this the other day:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34; data-lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Why don&amp;amp;#39;t so many teachers and professors understand that the test or assignment you can do in 15 minutes will take your beginning students at least an hour and probably a lot more to complete.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/zamansky/status/986609723557404673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;April 18, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;#34; charset=&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  What led to the tweet was a discussion I was having with some students about not having enough time on tests which led to a discussion of having to drop everything to spend every waking hour on a project.</description>
