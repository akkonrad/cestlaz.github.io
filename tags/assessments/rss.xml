      <description>I tweeted this the other day:
Why don&amp;#39;t so many teachers and professors understand that the test or assignment you can do in 15 minutes will take your beginning students at least an hour and probably a lot more to complete.
&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) April 18, 2018 
What led to the tweet was a discussion I was having with some students about not having enough time on tests which led to a discussion of having to drop everything to spend every waking hour on a project.</description>
