      <description>So many programming assignments involve a direct solution. Write a program to do this or write a problem to solve that. It&#39;s pretty typical. There&#39;s nothing wrong with assignments like these. They allow students to practice what they&#39;ve been learning and it gives them the opportunity to create some cool programs. All the same, I like it when there&#39;s an indirect problem. You&#39;re faced with a problem but in order to solve it you first have to solve some other problem</description>

      <description>This question appeared on Facebook a few days ago:
  Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down  a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my  students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in  subsequent parts.  There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn&#39;t have time then so I thought I&#39;d write it up now.</description>
