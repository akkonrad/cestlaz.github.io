      <description>Preamble   I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I was all for it.  JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening to.</description>
