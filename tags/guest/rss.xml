      <description>Preamble I&#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I was all for it.
JonAlf&#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really perceptive. When he has something to say it&#39;s 100% worth listening to.
To JonAlf - since I know this is one of my blog posts you&#39;ll actually read - you should set up a blog of your own.</description>
