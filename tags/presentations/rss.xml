Next weekend I&#39;ll be attending the Computer Science Teachers
Association&#39;s [[https://www.csteachers.org/general/custom.asp?page=2018Conference][annual conference.]] It&#39;s probably the biggest conference
focussed on K12 Computer Science education. This year, in addition to
attending, I&#39;ll be giving a talk on preservice and inservice CS
teacher preparation programs. I&#39;ll be talking about the new New York
State certification requirements along with what we&#39;re rolling out at
Hunter College.

This means putting together a slide deck for the session. When I have
to work collaboratively with non-Emacs users, I will usually go to
Google Docs for presentations. It works and the collaborative aspects
are nice but tools like Google Docs and Powerpoint are designed around
composing slides manually. I much prefer to use a tool where I can
focus on writing my presentation and have the tool turn it into a
presentation.

Org-mode is of course the ideal tool. As an outliner, it lends itself
to organizing a talk:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-org&#34; data-lang=&#34;org&#34;&gt;,* topic 1
the content for slide one
,* topic 2
the content for slide two
,* topic 3
etc.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
#+END_SRC

I can embed code, tables, images, and more. I can also cycle
visibility so I can focus on individual sections. Org-mode also has a
number of export options to take a plain org file which is just ascii
with markup and export it as a presentation. In the video, I&#39;ll take a
quick look at ~ox-beamer~, which exports to a Beamer presentation in LaTeX and then a PDF,
~epresent~ which presents right in Emacs and finally ~ox-reveal~ wich
creates a ~reveal.js~ presentation. I ultimately decide to continue to
use ~ox-reveal~ as it&#39;s pretty simple and flexible and I can also directly serve
the final presentation from my own laptop, a usb drive, or directly
from GitHub.

Check out the video to see how. If you want more information on using
~ox-reveal~ check out my earlier [[http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-11-reveal][Using Emacs post and video]].
