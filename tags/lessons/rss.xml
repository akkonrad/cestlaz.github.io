      <description>One thing I&#39;ve learned from teaching is that there&#39;s always something new to learn. For the kids, yes, but I&#39;m talking about for the teacher.
The other day, I taught a lesson I&#39;ve taught many times. Find the mode of a data set. That&#39;s the problem that they solve but the lesson is really about run time complexity, hidden complexity and using data structures in alternate ways.
I blogged about this before so you can get an earlier take there although the code isn&#39;t formatted correctly due to blog conversions.</description>
