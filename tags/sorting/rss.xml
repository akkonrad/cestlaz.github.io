      <description>Many teachers are reluctant to try new things. Sometimes it&#39;s a bad case of &#34;I&#39;vealwaysdoneitthisway-itis.&#34; Sometimes it&#39;s not being comfortable with the new way or not having the time to develop whatever happens to be needed for the lesson and sometimes it&#39;s even coming from a good place.
What&#39;s that good place? Concern - if I try this new way and it doesn&#39;t work I&#39;m going to lose some students and never get them back.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I saw a facebook post asking for thoughts on teaching sorting. The question was specifically not about motivations like having the class act out sorts or sort cards but rather about the coding.
I&#39;ve been meaning to write about this since last summer when I attended Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk on the same subject.
Early in my career when teaching sorting I developed the n^2 sorts as standalone routines just as they&#39;re presented in most books but as I gained more experience as a teacher, I changed it up to build the sorts (at least some of them) from existing concepts.</description>
