      <description>Advanced Placement Computer Science got top billing on Alfred Thompson&#39;s Things I&#39;m Watching in 2017 post. Alfred talks about how APCS-P exploded onto the scene and wonders what will happen with APCS this year.
I have some questions as well but mine won&#39;t be answered for years to come, if ever.
Like it or not, the College Board has an out sized influence on K12 education. As long as people are convinced that AP=good there will be a push for more and more AP classes and APCS-P is a perfect class to push.</description>
