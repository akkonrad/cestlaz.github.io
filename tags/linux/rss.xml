      <description>Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have finally arrived. We&amp;#39;re distributing them on Monday. Each student will have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they&amp;#39;re in the program.  This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying and sharing our projects.  For this type of web development, I&amp;#39;m a big fan of using Flask. Flask is a Python microframework.</description>

      <description>Saw this post the other day: Emacs is hurting Clojure and this response: Is Emacs Really HJard to Learn / Use.  This called to mind those countless discussions about tools being user friendly. I&amp;#39;m frequently on the unpopular side of these discussions. Linux vs Windows vs Mac, Shell vs GUI, Emacs vs fill-in-the-blank-editor-or-IDE and on and on.  Don&amp;#39;t use Emacs, it isn&amp;#39;t user friendly. Don&amp;#39;t use Linux, it isn&amp;#39;t user friendly.</description>

      <description>Quick post to add to the recent command line fu I&amp;#39;ve been writing about.  Douglas Peterson had another Whatever happened to post. This time on Logo. I wanted to reply, talk about NetLogo and link to some of my old NetLogo posts to help show how cool it is.  Nikola supports tags, makes a nice tags page and for each tag, a nice page of all the links.</description>

      <description>Over in the Facebook AP Computer Science Teachers group someone asked for thoughts on covering BASH scripting as a post AP topic.  A number of us made suggestions. I linked to this old blog post.  One group member said she asked around for similar suggestions and the response she got was &amp;#34;vi and awk.&amp;#34; I wanted to jokingly respond &amp;#34;and after they suggested that they got into their time machine and went back to the 70&amp;#39;s.</description>

      <description>Repost   This is a repost from March 2015. It didn&amp;#39;t transfer when I rebooted the blog. Original   Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.  We&amp;#39;re busy organizing CSTUY&amp;#39;s first hackathon. It&amp;#39;s going to be at SumAll, where we hold our weekly hacking sessions but while taking registration, we had a little program.  The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story â€“ when people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts, many don&amp;#39;t show.</description>
