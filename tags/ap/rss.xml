      <title>How early for APCS</title>

      <description>In what grade should students take APCS? This question comes up from time to time.
I&#39;ve heard answers ranging from middle school through never. Infact, years ago, my chairman relayed a conversation he had with Marvin Minsky where he asked Minsky what the high schools should be teaching with respect to CS. The answer was &#34;nothing.&#34; This was then amended to &#34;teach them to type.&#34; Of course this was a long time ago but I believe the sentiment was that college was the right time and the high schools don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing and will just screw up the kids.</description>

      <description>While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being available.
I&#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher first and part of the K12CS community. We&#39;re a growing community and we&#39;re growing fast.
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their results. &#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.</description>

      <title>APCS-P -  Bigger Intake Or Leaky Pipe</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/oldblog/apcsp-bigger-intake-or-leaky-pipe/</link>

      <description>Advanced Placement Computer Science got top billing on Alfred Thompson&#39;s Things I&#39;m Watching in 2017 post. Alfred talks about how APCS-P exploded onto the scene and wonders what will happen with APCS this year.
I have some questions as well but mine won&#39;t be answered for years to come, if ever.
Like it or not, the College Board has an out sized influence on K12 education. As long as people are convinced that AP=good there will be a push for more and more AP classes and APCS-P is a perfect class to push.</description>

      <title>Teaching APCS-A for the first time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/oldblog/teaching-ap-first-time/</link>

      <description>I got an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this year. He&#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&#39;t really done much using Java.
I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.
  TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn  your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&#39;s OK to tell  your kids &#34;</description>

      <title>The Cost of AP Exams</title>

      <description>Now that I&#39;m back from vacation and summer&#39;s winding down I thought I&#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a few summer topics I want to write about -- standards and side projects in particular but I&#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the classroom since, after all, at my core, I&#39;m a teacher. When I saw this article in my inbox this morning I thought I&#39;d talk about it.</description>

      <title>A Plea to AP teachers- don&#39;t measure yourself by your scores</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/oldblog/teachers-you-arent-your-test-scores/</link>

      <description>AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&#39;t, some don&#39;t really care.
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
Don&#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.
I never really cared much about my students&#39; actual AP scores.</description>
