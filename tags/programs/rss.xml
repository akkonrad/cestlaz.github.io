I&#39;ve been known to be &#34;prickly,&#34; which is a nice way of putting it and I&#39;m openly critical of many programs out there.
One program, however, that I very much like is TEALS. They&#39;ve been around since 2009 founded by Kevin Wang, a former teacher. The basic idea was to have tech professionals go to a school on the way to work and team teach a CS class with one of the school&#39;s teachers.</description>
