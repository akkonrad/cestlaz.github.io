      <description>The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &#34;How do I assess CS?&#34; I wanted to go but it&#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped out. Fortunately, the meetup was recorded. I was able to watch the first half this morning while working out on my stationary trainer which leads me to today&#39;s rare Saturday morning blog post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12 teachers who taught CS.</description>

The thread is about the level of difficulty of the various problems and Eric&#39;s comment talks about some of the factors that go into creating a good collection of problems for a contest and the difficulties involved.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was Catskillsconf - my favorite event of the year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great weekend but I was mostly offline.
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).</description>
