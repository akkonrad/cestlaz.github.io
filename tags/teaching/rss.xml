      <title>Computer Science is not (inherently) fun</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw a tweet the other day by a CS teacher. They were talking about
how much easier it is to teach CS because it&amp;#39;s fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They went on about how they get to create cool problems which makes it
so much easier to teach than other subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve heard this a lot over the years particularly from teachers who
are into gaming - &amp;#34;CS is fun because you can create games.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry but I have to disagree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.tenor.com%2Fimages%2F2394618fcb9a02e206f313155848d2d3%2Ftenor.gif%3Fitemid%3D5765989&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I think CS is fun (and I&amp;#39;m not a game person) but
just because I find it fun doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s inherently fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to think like those teachers posting but one day, early in my
career I was observed by my principal. She liked the lesson but
focused in on one thing. At one point I mentioned that we could use a
specific new technique and that it was &amp;#34;cool.&amp;#34; She asked me &amp;#34;why is it
cool?&amp;#34; and more importantly &amp;#34;why should it be cool for them?&amp;#34; That got
me thinking. It was cool to me for a variety of reasons but the truth
was that in a class of 30 high school students, what&amp;#39;s cool for one
person is probably not cool for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That observation stuck with me. Something that&amp;#39;s cool for some of us
isn&amp;#39;t for others. A teacher and some students might love making games
but it does nothing for me and for many students. Same thing for the
general building stuff or solving problems. The set of things that will and won&amp;#39;t
motivate students in a CS class is a large one indeed. Now, this
doesn&amp;#39;t mean don&amp;#39;t do, for instance, games but rather understand that your students
will have a wide range of interests so if you do a unit that focuses
on games, maybe do other things in your other units.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A second issue I have with the &amp;#34;CS is fun&amp;#34; thing is that it implies
that it&amp;#39;s all fun and games and not work. This is particularly a
problem transitioning from a CS0 to a CS1 class. If you don&amp;#39;t set up
the transition correctly students will find CS1 much more challenging
and harder and if it&amp;#39;s too hard or too challenging that&amp;#39;s not
fun. Besides, even if the class is fun, which should include being
challenging at the right level there will be times where things are
just not fun and that&amp;#39;s even with the best teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final thing that I find off putting about all the &amp;#34;computer
science is fun&amp;#34; posts. I think it&amp;#39;s unfair to other teachers and other
subjects. History can be tremendous fun - stories, adventures,
mysteries, predictions and more. It can be taught through traditional
lessons, role play, art music and the list goes on. English? That&amp;#39;s
also stories, adventures, mysteries etc.. Physics? How about show and
tell how the world works? To say we have the monopoly on fun is not
true and unfair. We currently don&amp;#39;t have the burden history which
strictly dictates what, how, and when we teach but we&amp;#39;re getting there
quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that CS will be inherently fun for some just like any
other subject and the specifics of what and how a class is taught and
to whom can greatly influence the level of fun. A strong teacher who&amp;#39;s
passionate about games teaching a game development elective will
probably be fun for most or all participants but if it were a required
course, not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CS is our field, we find it fun and interesting and we want to bring
our passion to our students. That&amp;#39;s all good but let&amp;#39;s remember that
it&amp;#39;s not special and we&amp;#39;re not special. The same can be said for other
subjects and other teachers and we have to remember that it&amp;#39;s not
about our passions but rather those of our students.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching Styles</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-styles/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 08:31:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-styles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Emmanuel lamented over on Facebook on &amp;#34;Learning Styles,&amp;#34; or
more specifically on how it&amp;#39;s still given credence. We all chimed in
in agreement but not an hour later I saw a Twitter thread where
education thought leaders extolled the virtues of Learning Styles all
over again. I pointed out that it&amp;#39;s a great example as to why so many
teachers scoff at &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;research backed practices.&amp;#34;
We&amp;#39;ve seen it all before. We&amp;#39;re told we have to teach one way or we&amp;#39;re
failures only to be told a few years later that we have to do
something else. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily the research (although I question
a good deal of what I&amp;#39;ve read) but also the interpretations and
implementations. There are just too many factors that are never
considered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One factor that I&amp;#39;ve rarely seen mentioned but one I think about
frequently, particularly as I work with teachers is &amp;#34;teaching styles.&amp;#34;
I&amp;#39;m not talking about any deep science here but we know that teachers
are people and people have tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, and
preferences. These are factors that are so important to teaching but
rarely considered. It&amp;#39;s always &amp;#34;teach this way&amp;#34; and never what works
for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Think about how ridiculous that is. In what other field do we ignore
the individual strengths, tendencies and even comfort level of the
professional. In sports, we know that there are &amp;#34;player&amp;#39;s coaches&amp;#34; and
&amp;#34;disciplinarians&amp;#34; and players and teams might take better to one or
the other. Likewise, a coaches act can grow stale over time as the
team evolves. Similarly a great coach works their system to the
strengths of the players and doesn&amp;#39;t rigidly try to make players
conform to a system where they just don&amp;#39;t fit. Now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean
that a coach won&amp;#39;t try to develop a players weaknesses or try to move
towards their favored system but the greats look at the skills and
personalities of all involved. It also doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can&amp;#39;t
evolve. Former NY Giants coach Tom Coughlin was a rigid
disciplinarian and almost lost the team and his job prior to their Super Bowl run
in 2007. He evolved - became more of a players coach. He didn&amp;#39;t change
his stripes. He was still a stickler for rules and details but he
brought in a new human dimension to his coaching game. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to teaching. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While you want teachers to have a large set of tools in the box they
are going to be better with some than with others. Of course you can&amp;#39;t
ignore the students and how they respond but it&amp;#39;s not a one way
street. Take my friend Jim. He&amp;#39;s one of the best two or three natural
teachers I know. I describe him as &amp;#34;the teacher I aspire to be.&amp;#34; He&amp;#39;s
amazing. Stylistically though he&amp;#39;s what I call traditional teacher
dominant. He presents, there are questions comments and answer, seat
work. Pretty old school stuff. He doesn&amp;#39;t fit the constructivist mold
nor the cooperative one but he&amp;#39;s the best. I remember talking to our
principal a number of years ago. They said &amp;#34;I can&amp;#39;t bring
superintendents and DOE officials to Jim&amp;#39;s class when they visit and
want to see what we&amp;#39;re doing. He&amp;#39;s great but they just wouldn&amp;#39;t
understand and we&amp;#39;d get a lower school rating.&amp;#34; He&amp;#39;s the best but he
doesn&amp;#39;t fit Danielson. Now before you give me the &amp;#34;but it doesn&amp;#39;t
count, he teaches at Stuy&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ll share that prior to teaching at Stuy
he taught at an overall low performing neighborhood school and
experience notwithstanding, he was the best then too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What makes Jim the best? He has his preferred style and he adjusts to
what his students need. He&amp;#39;ll take an assortment of tools out of his
belt - some discovery stuff here, some group work there but he&amp;#39;ll work
it in to augment his strengths rather than being something he&amp;#39;s not
and as a result being inauthentic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For my part I too am traditional teacher dominant. I&amp;#39;m not anywhere
close to Jim&amp;#39;s level. I consider myself an above average in class
teacher who brings other things to the table and makes up for it with
honesty, sincerity, and loyalty. I&amp;#39;m 100% &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a Danielson teacher
nor am I a cooperative learning one which was all the rage when I
started my career. I&amp;#39;ll try to get new ideas and learn new techniques
and pick and choose and overall it&amp;#39;s worked pretty well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that when teaching teachers or coaching them,
don&amp;#39;t try to turn them into you or into John Keating, Jaime Escalante,
or what have you (note to self, write up teacher movie rant some
day). Help them to look at who they are and what they bring to the
table. Mix that with the needs of their students and the cosntraints
of their teaching situation and help them to be the best they cab be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teaching styles, for lack of a better name is too frequently missing
from the education equation. It&amp;#39;s totally removed by those who want
scripted curricula and cookie cutter instruction and barely mentioned
anywhere else but teaching styles are an important component of great
teaching and I wish more people acknowledged this.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deadlines And Commitments</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/deadlines-and-commitments/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:50:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/deadlines-and-commitments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A few days ago I was part of a Twitter discussion on assignment
deadlines. I noticed a tweet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Not sure who needs to hear this, but stop taking off points for late assignments. It’s not helping students learn responsibility, and it’s not making your job easier. It’s only making your class inequitable. 💯&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sydney Jensen (@sydneycjensen) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sydneycjensen/status/1309946435056611335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I disagreed. I wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily against floating or open deadlines
without deductions but rather, they made my life more difficult and
weren&amp;#39;t in the best interest of my students. That said, they could
very well be appropriate for Sydney and her&amp;#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I saw some emails on the SIGCSE list on the same topic. One
caught my eye - the poster talked about giving extra credit for early
submissions. These were likely unrelated discussions since the twitter
participants were not CS educators and I think the SIGCSE discussion
was mostly of college level CS instructors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, it was a sign. I was meant to write a blog post on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, what&amp;#39;s my policy?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For homework or small every day assignments I grade for attempt, not
correctness. You either made an honest effort or you didn&amp;#39;t. I
encourage students to help each other but ask they cite where and when
they got help. When all is said and done, if you&amp;#39;ve done most of the
homework you get the full homework percent of the grade. If you miss
one here or there, no big deal. If you miss a whole bunch, you&amp;#39;ve got
a problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For projects, I have hard deadlines with a deduction for lateness. If
time and circumstance permits, I&amp;#39;ll give a project and we&amp;#39;ll have a
discussion and set the due date together. Also, if a student talks to
me ahead of time about some issue, I&amp;#39;ll almost always give a penalty
free extension. On the other hand, if they come to me last minute, I
usually won&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I grade, and I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; grading, I get into a groove so grading a
project later does inconvenience me and it&amp;#39;s also not doing the
student any favors - we&amp;#39;ve moved on to the next set of topics but I
don&amp;#39;t have the project which is an assessment of how the student was
doing up to that point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this bad? I don&amp;#39;t think so. While many deadlines are arbitrary,
students do have to learn to get things done and as long as the
deadline is reasonable there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem. Since I&amp;#39;m
flexible if a student has a particular issue even more so. One
tweet on the thread said that since some students aren&amp;#39;t comfortable
asking a teacher for an extension it was unfair but I think you have
to draw the line somewhere. One students might not ask for an
extension and just be late and another might not ask and kill
themselves to meet the deadline but in either case, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s
unreasonable to expect the student to advocate for themselves
particularly when they can start the conversation either in person or
via email and in private. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, is having open deadlines all good? Probably
not. Some students will game and abuse the system. Not all, but
certainly some and those students will gain an advantage in terms of
grades. Now, in an ideal world. we wouldn&amp;#39;t care about grades but in
the current reality if student one gets a fair B+ while student two
exploits loose deadlines nad gets an A-, guess who&amp;#39;s more likely to
get into that selective college? There&amp;#39;s also the problem of
snowballing and falling behind. If a student is a week late on
something that reinforces or clarifies the next topic that student is
now falling behind on that next topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also have the final looming deadline of end of semester or end of
year which further complicates matters. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, who&amp;#39;s right? Who knows. Overall, I think what I do works for me
and my classes. It&amp;#39;s a system that&amp;#39;s evolved over three decades and
will continue to evolve. Every year is a potential tweak and every new
situation, like when I came over to Hunter was cause for
re-evaluation. On the other hand, I know teachers who have open
deadlines and it seems to work for them and their students so they
should keep on keeping on. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about that extra credit for early projects? This is one that
sounds good but I don&amp;#39;t like it. I think this one is potentially
really inequitable. It sounds good until you remember that students
all have different schedules and different obligations. If you give
students one week to complete an assignment starting monday, even if
they all have roughly the same workload, it will be distributed in
different ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One kid might front load their courses into Mon-Wed so they don&amp;#39;t have
to commute Thursday and Friday. That student will never be able to
finish an assignment early because they&amp;#39;ve left there homework time
for later in the week. Same thing for a kid who works evenings rather
than weekends. There will be other kids where their schedule favors
finishing early. This sounds like a great idea but it will really only
favor a select few and not necessarily because they&amp;#39;re doing things
&amp;#34;the right way.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the answer on due dates? As usual we get a resouding &amp;#34;it
depends.&amp;#34; I just gave an assignment last Monday and over Zulip we
collectively decided that a fair deadline would be a week from
today. I don&amp;#39;t expect any extensions will be needed but if I&amp;#39;m
approached I&amp;#39;ll probably be flexible as I&amp;#39;ve always been. My policy
seems to be working well so I&amp;#39;m sticking to it for now. If yours works
for you, do the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quarter Century Courses</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/quarter-century-courses/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:09:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/quarter-century-courses/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was talking in our Curriculum Development class last week about the
courses I&amp;#39;ve created over the years. From the first computer graphics
course to the current teacher education courses. JonAlf pointed out
that we missed an &amp;#34;important&amp;#34; occasion last spring - the twenty fifth
offering of my computer graphics class at Stuy. I haven&amp;#39;t taught it in
almost 10 years but it&amp;#39;s been running continuously for a quarter
century since it first ran back in the mid 90s. Systems will hit that
mark this year and the intro course I designed a couple of years from
now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s pretty cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking back at all the courses I&amp;#39;ve designed and taught it&amp;#39;s
interesting to see what I got right, what I got wrong, and why. Some
courses evolved slowly over time. The intro course fits that bill. On
the other hand, Systems had a complete reboot a few years in and has
been reasonably stable since. Interestingly enough Graphics has
probably been the most stable over the years. That&amp;#39;s not to say that
it hasn&amp;#39;t been tweaked here and there but overall, it&amp;#39;s largely the
same now as it was a quarter century ago. It&amp;#39;s been re-evaluated many
times but it just turns out that when I was teaching it I felt that it
was still hitting the right notes and my successor seems to feel
similarly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny because graphics was designed with the least thought of all of
my courses. I probably didn&amp;#39;t feel that way at the time, but it&amp;#39;s
true. I had only been teaching around 5 year - a beginner at best and
didn&amp;#39;t really know what I was doing. Even 10 years in you&amp;#39;re still an
advanced beginner in terms of teaching. Most teachers, if they don&amp;#39;t
burn out, hit there stride at 15 - 20 and after that become truly
experienced. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I basically created graphics because I was teaching 4 APCS/AB classes
and one geometry and &lt;strong&gt;hated&lt;/strong&gt; grading proofs!!!! I needed to create one
more CS class. I decided on graphics because I knew I could teach it
and thought the students might enjoy it. Systems was created using
similarly deep contemplations. I got better and spent much more time
and effort designing future courses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the graphics class I had a few choices to make but not many. The
students mostly only knew Pascal from APCS so the language wasn&amp;#39;t an
issue like it would become later on and since we were working on DOS
machines running Turbo Pascal there wasn&amp;#39;t any option to use any fancy
library like OpenGL. The course basically started with the ability to
draw a point and then went though: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lines
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lines in 3D and 3D transformations
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
polygons (triangles)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A motion description language interpreter (stack and tree based
shape hierarchies)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lighting and shading
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ray tracing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The motion description language piece had an entire unit that was
really an intro to compilers / interpreters. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In retrospect, the course really did make sense. It was taught to
second term seniors so it was a terminal course. It combined the
programming, algorithms and data structures from APCS, math they
did in trig, precalc (and baby calc), and a bit of physics. It as also
project based and they wrote programs that made pretty pictures so
that helped stave off senioritis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the course has remained largely the same, there has been some
evolution. When Systems students started learning C we ended up
supporting that as well in graphics and now the course is more
language agnostic. We also played with topics and unit length. We
spend less time on the compiler piece now and treat that more like a
black box and have at times looked at additional topics like texture
mapping. There&amp;#39;s also been a good deal of work put in to safety nets
and scaffolding. When you have a course where the main assessment is
one BIG semester long project you&amp;#39;ve got to make sure students don&amp;#39;t
end up falling into a hole they can&amp;#39;t climb out of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not a surprise that the first couple of courses I designed -
graphics and systems were somewhat arbitrary. Graphics turned out to
be a solid design and just needed some fine tuning but Systems got a
complete reboot. Over the years, I learned more about curriculum
design and feel pretty comfortable designing new experiences now. Of
course, this is thirty years into my career as a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I&amp;#39;ll talk about the design of other classes here in the future
but for now, you can look at one of my first student&amp;#39;s graphics
project and read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/class-legends/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Multiple Cameras For Remote Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/multiple-cameras-for-remote-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:05:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/multiple-cameras-for-remote-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We used Zoom for remote classes over the summer but at this point,
I&amp;#39;ve also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingrooms.com&#34;&gt;Coding Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bigbluebutton.org&#34;&gt;Big Blue Button&lt;/a&gt;, and Google meet as
well. They each have their own strong points and failings but all are
limited in terms of sharing multiple cameras and screen
components. All will let you share your camera or share your screen
and when you share you screen you can either share it all or a single
window. Zoom is the only one that seems to allow for easy camera
switching but it&amp;#39;s still pretty clunky.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why do I want to switch cameras? Because I can&amp;#39;t draw us ing a mouse or
touchpad. I&amp;#39;ve gotten myself a Wacom tablet but am still not
particularly proficient at it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I got myself one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TTIP40/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; to use as a document camera. It worked
but as I said, switching between the webcam and document camera was
clunky at best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OBS to the rescue!!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; Studio is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;Open Broadcaster Software&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a cross platform
streaming studio. You can set up any number of devices and then
compose them into scenes. I use it for recording my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; videos. It&amp;#39;s
easy to set up devices for every camera you own plus monitors and
individual windows. It only took a minute or so to set up a scene with
me in the corner and my desktop: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/desktop.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One for my document camera: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/doccam.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And one for my desktop with the doccam overlayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/mixed.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can switch between them by clicking on which I want. I can also
select a transition like fade. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is all great for recording or streaming to a service like Twitch
but what about using with meeting software? It turns out that you can
set up OBS to act as a virtual camera. There are plugins for Mac and
Windows. You can find them by searching for them but for Linux, I
followed this video and it worked perfectly: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eca509IDLdM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also found this video if the above one doesn&amp;#39;t work: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJSkj-dLoI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJSkj-dLoI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I set up the virtual camera as per the video and then selected it as
the camera on both Zoom and Coding Rooms and it worked perfectly. It
should work on the other platforms as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is HUGE. Now, instead of explicitly sharing my screen I can hacve
my screen as my image and quickly and easily switch over to another
window, a document camera or anything else. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re teaching remotely using a conferencing platform I recommend
you check this out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting the new semester</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-semester/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:56:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-semester/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thursday was the first day of the new semester. The big change was
that my classes were done remotely but there were also some other
differences. Other changes were that I only met one of my two CS
classes on Thursday. That&amp;#39;s my CS0. I&amp;#39;m also teaching a recitation for
CS1 which only meets once a week. I&amp;#39;ll see those students as well as
my CS0 students for a second time on Monday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I opted to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingrooms.com/&#34;&gt;Coding Rooms&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom since Coding Rooms has a
nice built in REPL. We had a couple of students drop a couple of times
and I had to reload once but even that&amp;#39;s no worse than typical Zoom
performance. It&amp;#39;s funny how once one product becomes &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; everything
that&amp;#39;s different is labeled as harder and whenever there&amp;#39;s a hiccup
it&amp;#39;s so much worse. The truth is, I&amp;#39;ve now used a bunch of platforms
and none is harder than the others - you just have to look to
different places. For example, in Zoom, you &amp;#34;raise your hand&amp;#34; by
clicking in one place and in Coding Rooms (or Big Blue Button)
another. Neither is inherently better - just different but people seem
to think that the non Zoom one is worse just because Zoom got so hot
so fast. Likewise, other platforms periodically drop people and crash
but so does Zoom. This is all a digression but it&amp;#39;s something that
bothers me. Zoom does some things really well but then again so do the
other platforms I&amp;#39;ve been playing with. So far, there&amp;#39;s no silver
bullet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you might imagine, class had a different feel. I think it went
pretty well but it&amp;#39;s certainly going to be harder to build a sense of
community. Since there was a good deal of class logistics to cover we
didn&amp;#39;t really get to play with the Coding Rooms REPL but I&amp;#39;ll report
on that soon. I&amp;#39;ll also mention that we&amp;#39;re going to see about using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zulip.com/&#34;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; instead of Slack for chat both in class and out. Like Zoom,
Slack is the de facto standard but Zulip seems to have a few distinct
advantages: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s open source
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can self host it (and it&amp;#39;s free if you self host)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s built around threads so I suspect it will be easier to deal
with discussions both synchronously and asynchronously more easily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The disadvantages are that there aren&amp;#39;t as many integrations, most
notably there&amp;#39;s no Giphy and it&amp;#39;s not the eponymous chat
platform. Note that it&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t like Slack but was driven to
look for alternatives because I don&amp;#39;t have a budget and the free tier
has limited history and I believe integrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big change this semester involve our K12 CS teacher
certification program. Our summer cohort kicked off there next two
classes on Thursday afternoon and evening - Ethics in Computer Science
and Curriculum Development for CS. I designed both courses but am not
the official teacher. Topher and JonAlf who worked the summer with me
are each taking one but I&amp;#39;m going to be very involved. We also had
four students start in our Masters program. I&amp;#39;ll be writing about all
of this over the course of the school year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spent most of yesterday getting ready for Monday - setting up the
Zulip server, GitHub repos and GitHub classroom and the like. As
usual, I&amp;#39;m a slow starter but hopefully by mid next week will feel
like I&amp;#39;m in the swing of things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 12:00:15 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-successes-and-failures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking back, what worked and what didn&amp;#39;t?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, things went very well. We were extremely happy with the
cohort&amp;#39;s growth and performance and based on feedback received they
were happy with the program so far. I&amp;#39;ll also say that while they&amp;#39;re
not finished yet, I can honestly say that every one of them would be a
boon to any school in the city in need of a CS teacher (but they&amp;#39;re
not available since they&amp;#39;re all already teaching CS at their
respective schools :-)). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we started we felt good about our combination our program -
designed by teachers for teachers. Strong pedagogy combined with deep
CS content. Now that we&amp;#39;re done with the summer, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to
say that both our design and implementation is sound. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean the program was perfect. We lost one student along
the way. That was unfortunate but sometimes the fit isn&amp;#39;t there. There
are also a few things we&amp;#39;d like to tweak. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/pre-acceptance-prework&#34;&gt;pre-work&lt;/a&gt; - we required it due to the compressed nature of
the summer. Next time around it&amp;#39;s going to be available earlier and
with more support. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also want to do a better job with early pacing but now that we&amp;#39;ve
had our first rodeo we can do that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The one nut we haven&amp;#39;t cracked is that due to the teachers experience
combined with the pre-work there are some early learning / teaching CS
issues that didn&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t come up naturally as the students are
beyond them before our first day. Things like issues that come up when
introducing variables or functions. We could just insert them as a
unit but that breaks the class flow. I&amp;#39;m still noodling that one but
for now they&amp;#39;re probably good topics for a school year PD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s next?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cohort will continue with two more courses starting up in just a
couple of weeks. One is an Ethics in CS class that I&amp;#39;m really excited
about and the other is Curriculum Development. The Curriculum
Development class has been a personal project. I had to take three
different graduate curriculum development courses over my career and
didn&amp;#39;t learn a single thing about designing curriculum in any of
them. Years ago, before I had any clue I&amp;#39;d be building this program I
told myself that if I ever did design and teach any education courses
I&amp;#39;d do a curriculum development course and it would be good. Well, her
it is. We&amp;#39;ll look at the standards and standard offerings but the crux
of the course will have the students designing curriculum. Since the
course is integrated with the NY State required field work they&amp;#39;ll
also be implementing what they build with their students. It should be
pretty cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of all this, we also have four students starting in our Masters
in CS Education program. Those four are just starting their journey
towards becoming teachers. They&amp;#39;ll take general pedagogy courses in
teh Fall and Spring and then join with our next cohort in the summer
to start the CS and CS Ed part of our program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long road to get here but now we&amp;#39;re here - preparing CS
teachers for NY city and state. When I came to Hunter this was one of
my two major initiatives. The thought was that regardless how bad the
powers that be screw CS education up, if you have great teachers,
students have a chance. At Hunter we&amp;#39;re preparing those great
teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS Teachers - building a community</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-community/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:11:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-community/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What so many non-teachers just don&amp;#39;t get is culture and community can
be so much more powerful than curriculum. The problem is, culture and
community are harder to create, curate, and maintain and the results
don&amp;#39;t always show up on standardized tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t force community or culture  in a classroom but you can try
your best to foster it. It&amp;#39;s ultimately up to the class as a
whole. It&amp;#39;s like I tell groups who come to events I organize. I can&amp;#39;t
make an event awesome, all I can do is bring everyone together and set
the stage. It&amp;#39;s up to us all to collectively make the event work. More
often than not, it does. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For our part, we did what we always do. We did our best to be open and
honest about what we were doing, how, and why. We sincerely tried to
listen to input and we worked to make ourselves available to our
students. We also looked to set our class tone as informal but
serious, and hopefully fun. We could take time for tangents but
remembered when it was time to get back on task. It&amp;#39;s the typical
balance a teacher seeks to create and maintain. There was no magic on
our end, we did what we always did - we were ourselves. It probably
helped that there were three of us and could already play off each
other Marx brothers style (oh, who am I kidding, more three stooges)
but all a teacher can really do is open the door. The other thing we
did was provide the tools - Slack and GitHub Discussions (even though
it didn&amp;#39;t take) and we did pre-load Slack with channels both serious
and not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The class walked through. They decided to engage and that started the
ball rolling. Of course we still had our part to play. If they posted
something, we had to respond, or at least be an active part in the
discussion. Now, understand, we didn&amp;#39;t respond as &amp;#34;part of the job.&amp;#34;
That would be fake and they&amp;#39;d know it. We&amp;#39;d respond because we&amp;#39;re also
part of the community. We wanted them to be part of it and we wanted
to be part of it. That&amp;#39;s what community is all about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While community and class culture is something that&amp;#39;s always
important. In this case, I think it&amp;#39;s even more important. New York
City and State, like the rest of the country has very few CS teachers
that are both strong in CS content and in CS pedagogy and since NY
State just started approving certification programs, including ours,
there are currently no state certified CS teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When they finish the program, this cohort should be among New York&amp;#39;s
first certified CS teachers but even now, they have more CS content
knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge than most of the people
teaching CS. They&amp;#39;re also all experienced teachers in general. This
group can seed a community of CS teachers with strong
backgrounds. It&amp;#39;s on them to go back to CS4All in and run professional
developments and to work with us at Hunter to host events as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ve already said how terrific the group is and how honored I
am to work with them and as a community we&amp;#39;re well on the way. Even as
I&amp;#39;m writing this post, I&amp;#39;m seeing new messages appear on our community
Slack discussion school openings and this is well after our summer
program has ended. They&amp;#39;re already becoming resources for each
other. In a couple of weeks, for their students, and soon for the rest
of the teachers in New York.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS teachers - Curricula don&#39;t add richness, teachers do</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics-curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:25:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&amp;#39;ll hear from a school or
someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&amp;#39;ll ask
for a course they can drop in and teach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I explain it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only
so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a
great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A curriculum only goes so far. At it&amp;#39;s most sparse, it&amp;#39;s a list of
topics. At the other end we frequently see worked out prescribed
lessons that can be a boon to a beginner but in the end constrains
great teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a side note, this was something I noticed years ago when touring
elementary schools for my own children. We saw one school where
everything was in lockstep - every classroom looked basically the
same. Every teacher taught the same subject at the same time as every
other teacher each day and what they taught and how they taught it was
tightly controlled. We opted for  a school where the teachers were
much more free to actually teach. The school in question was well
regarded and the more we dug in the more we realized that the
strictness the principal imposed helped bring the bad teachers up to a
certain level and got most students through the standardized tests but
there was no joy. Great teachers weren&amp;#39;t allowed to teach. It was a
perfect example of a Bloomberg era stat mill. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway back to CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about this while we watched the summer cohort&amp;#39;s topic
presentations. Three of the topics were ones that I teach annually -
AI Search, NLP, and Cipher decryption. Some of the others I&amp;#39;m planning
on mixing in next year. The presentations and supporting materials
were all terrific but in every case, the teachers chose to spin and
emphasize aspects different to those I would emphasize.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the case of the cipher decryption lesson, the cohort emphasized the
machine learning type aspect. I spin the lesson more towards a
recommender system. Neither is better or worse. My guess is that we
each selected aspects that were exciting to us and riffed on
those. Similarly the other groups brought up nuances and emphases that
differed from mine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was terrific.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you look at a syllabus, the search topic might just say &amp;#34;Depth
First Search.&amp;#34; It might be in the recursion section of the class and
thus lead you to teaching a recursive solution or it might be in
the data structure / stack section and lead you to implement your own
stack. If the curriculum is fleshed out it&amp;#39;ll give more specifics but
will it talk about states and state space? How about implicit data
structures? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s so much richness to a well taught course that&amp;#39;s never captured
by a curriculum and that includes tangents, side stories and limitless
discoveries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I talk to my students decades later it&amp;#39;s usually not those lines
on the syllabus they remember but the richness that lives in the ether
of a well taught class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So cool that our certification program created an environment where
we&amp;#39;ve been able to mix the spices from so many different chefs and
each of us is leaving with something new and richer.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Teacher Certification - Topics in CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 07:13:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Officially, the last course of the summer was &amp;#34;Modern Topics in
Computer Science.&amp;#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand
need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data
structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix
teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with
independent or semi-independant explorations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester
course, they&amp;#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of
weeks on each. We wanted to do it a little differently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original thought was to integrate some of the topics in with the
earlier computer science but there weren&amp;#39;t too many opportunities due
to the compressed nature of the program. Instead, a few days before we
wrapped up data structures we gave the cohort a list of potential
topics and asked them to select one. Since the cohort had all already
been teaching CS and had differing content backgrounds we also
encouraged them to choose a topic not on the list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it was time for them to begin work on the topics part of the
intensive, they all shared their desired topic. Fortunately, things
worked out. We ended up with two solo students and a bunch of small
teams. The teams were tasked with learning about the topic and
designing a lesson or unit covering it. This could be for their
current students or some other hypothetical group. Each group would
also have to create a program or programs to show an implementation
and or use of the topic. Once they chose their topics, we picked a few
out of the remaining selections as topics that we&amp;#39;d present. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next few days were Topher, JonAlf and I delivering our topics and
the cohort working in groups. When they worked, we&amp;#39;d drop in and
support. The final two days consisted of the groups presenting their
work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The topics they selected were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Mining
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Public Key Encryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blockchain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Natural Language Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Decision Trees
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SQL / Cyber Security
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Visualization
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Machine Learning / Cipher Decryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Genetic Algorithms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Search
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We weren&amp;#39;t sure exactly what to expect but we were blown away both in
terms of the CS content as well as what they prepared in terms of
lessons and units. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this is just year one of the program we thought we&amp;#39;d get ahead
of the game and set up a site where we could host and share these
units and other resources so check them out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/Teacher-Resources/blob/master/README.org&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We didn&amp;#39;t have a strict format for the cohort to use so each one is a
little different but each link&amp;#39;s README.md file will get you started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, we were blown away by their work but super proud that we
also have the bonus of being able to make their work available to the
general CS Ed community. If you&amp;#39;re looking to create a unit in any of
these, check them out.

      <title>Preparing teachers to teach CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-recap-intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 06:16:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-recap-intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that the summer portion of Hunter College&amp;#39;s Advanced Certificate
in Teaching Computer Science is over I thought I&amp;#39;d do a
postmortem. That is, a few posts about what we did and how it all
went. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, though, an overview of the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Advanced Certificate program is geared towards teachers who are
currently certified in another subject area who wish to earn an
additional New York State teaching certificate in Computer
Science. Aspiring teachers - people who don&amp;#39;t currently have either a
Masters degree or any teaching certification can enroll in our Masters
in Computer Science Education program. We&amp;#39;re starting a small cohort
of five on that in the Fall. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The certificate program consists of a bunch of graduate classes plus
field work which is required by the state. Over the summer we covered
four of the classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programming - essentially a CS1 type course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Structures - since K12 teachers should go deeper than the last
HS course which is typically APCS-A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Topcs in Compute rScience - since K12 teachers need a wide breadth
of CS knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Methods - since teachers need to know how to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the fall, we&amp;#39;ll continue with Ethics in Computer Science and
Curriculum Development which also includes the field work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For this summer we started with a cohort of 22 practicing teachers but
lost one along the way. They all came from different schools and we
had all five boroughs represented. Most of the teachers worked in high
schools but we had some middle school representation and in terms of
current certifications, we had at least math, special ed, and science
represented but that&amp;#39;s something we didn&amp;#39;t officially track.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Staffing wise, it was me along with two of my long time collaborators
JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver and Topher Mykolyk. JonAlf and Topher are two of
the best educators out there and part of my former core team at
Stuy. That team is the biggest thing I still miss having come over to
Hunter. They&amp;#39;re quite simply the best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The program ran basically all day every day during the month of
July. we knew it would be tight so we also added on some pre-work
which made sure all participants had some experience with Java prior
to our official start. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More will be revealed over the next few posts but I&amp;#39;ll spoil the
ending - I&amp;#39;m super proud of our 21 participants - while they still
have more work to do to earn their certifications, if I ran a school,
I&amp;#39;d love to have any of them teaching my CS classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not planning on writing much about the programming and data
structure classes except possibly through the methods eye because both
of those courses are pretty well established and cut and dry but I do
plan to write at least the following: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The methods course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More on the methods course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The topics course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use of tools for remote teaching 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our overall philosophy in designing and running the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, stay tuned for more.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pro Version Or Education Version</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pro-version-or-ed-version/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 19:00:13 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pro-version-or-ed-version/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I woke up to this tweet by Mark Guzdial today:#pro-version-or
ed-version.org#
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;An indication
that CS Ed in US high schools is about vocational training: 2 (of 5)
recommended sessions at the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csteachersorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@csteachersorg&lt;/a&gt;
conference are on Github and Agile. Is &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CSforALL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@CSforAll&lt;/a&gt;
a Silicon Valley jobs program? &lt;a
href=&#34;https://t.co/n8ugnmTU84&#34;&gt;https://t.co/n8ugnmTU84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash;
Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) &lt;a
href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial/status/1265986599952822272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;May
28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async
src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;
charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This led to a lively discussion throughout the day with lots of likes
and lots of comments. Two themes emerged. One wondered if the CSTA
conference should be highlighting these talks about professional
sensibilities and the other questioned the use of tools designed for
industry vs those designed for schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at the former first. For full disclosure JonAlf and I are
co-presenters of the GitHub session that was highlighted. Truth be
told I had no idea it was highlighted until I read Mark&amp;#39;s tweet
:-). CSTA is a conference for teachers, K12 teachers. Teachers go
to learn new practices. Sure there are sessions about advocacy and
the like but
it&amp;#39;s really more like a multi day professional development session on
steroids. That&amp;#39;s one of the things that makes it so wonderful. If a
session gives teachers something of value it&amp;#39;s worth presenting. It
can be what they teach, how they teach, or something ancillary to
teaching even things as mundane as gradebook management. If it helps
make a CS teacher better, it&amp;#39;s appropriate to include. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can&amp;#39;t say why any particular session was chosen for highlight
but it really isn&amp;#39;t a big deal. There are always sessions on specific lesson
ideas, cross curricular stuff, ethics, standards, equity, CS4All,
APCS, and lots lots more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, what I&amp;#39;d like to see would be a banner on the conference page
where every time you go there it displays a random assortment of
sessions that are being offered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the second point - professional tools or educational ones. First
let&amp;#39;s lump things together, git is a tool, so is GitHub. Same for
agile - it&amp;#39;s a tools as are programming languages. Now a great
craftsman is a great craftsman but their job is a whole lot easier
with a full chest of quality tools. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If a professional tool makes a teacher better it&amp;#39;s worth learning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s look at agile. I&amp;#39;ve never used terms like scrum or sprint in my
class but pair programming comes out of agile and that&amp;#39;s become a
mainstay of CS classes. Same thing for the short development cycle and
all the testing. These are agile concepts that we take for granted as
education tools. Are we going to use everything about agile in every
CS class? No. Does it belong in CS when CS is embedded in other
subject areas? Who knows but if a teacher gets exposed to it at CSTA
then they can make an informed decision and use it when and as
appropriate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about git/GitHub? I wouldn&amp;#39;t teach using it when CS is embedded
but I might in a HS programming course and I certainly would in APCS-A
or beyond. I&amp;#39;ve found that there are many positives of using them and
I&amp;#39;ve written about it before on this blog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that both git and agile provide ways of increasing
student communication and collaboration and these are good things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if I decided that my classes shouldn&amp;#39;t use git, I&amp;#39;d still use it
for my web presence and to distribute materials and that too makes it
worth learning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just because a tool came from industry it&amp;#39;s not
necessarily bad and if it came fro education it&amp;#39;s not necessarily
good. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thonny is a beginner Python IDE. It was designed specifically to be a
learner environment. It&amp;#39;s great for that. Eclipse is a professional
IDE and I hate it for education. Other people disagree with me on both
counts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand I&amp;#39;ve seen tools written by people in education that
are god awful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then you also have well designed education tools but they fill a
narrow niche - they&amp;#39;re so specialize that a teacher and student can
only use them in a specific case. A teacher then needs to find
multiple tools for their multiple classes and students need to learn
even more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume we have a bunch of these educational tools and their all
pretty well designed and help students get to whatever it is they&amp;#39;re
supposed to learn. Taken individually each tool seems great but taken
as a whole? Where&amp;#39;s the line? Is it better to have the teacher learn
and support a handful of these and students learn even more or should
they spend more time/efforn to learn one or two tools where the tool
will beuseful beyond the narrow scope of the specialized one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The answer is of course, it depends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was part of a workshop this past summer and this came up. We were
looking at a pretty sweet specialized tool that worked really well for
one niche area. We also looked at Google Sheets which were less
intuitive but more versatile and universal. Which to use? We never
came up with a compelling answer either way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nothing inherently bad about industry tools and there&amp;#39;s
nothing inherently good about educational ones. It&amp;#39;s true that
industry tools are designed for industry but education tools are by
and large not designed by teachers. They might be designed by people
who teach as part of their job or who have taught but that&amp;#39;s not the
same thing. Sometimes they hit but sometimes they miss their mark.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In math class we would typically draw arcs and circles on the board
with a giant chalk compass. It was specifically designed for
education. You know what works better? A shoelace.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Varying Remote Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/varying-remote-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:33:20 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/varying-remote-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
When we first went remote I jumped on Zoom. I already new the
technology and it most simulated a live class. Basically, it was the
best combination if quick, easy, and effective and we were under the
gun to get something going and give our students some sense of
normalcy and continuity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As we settled in though, it made sense to try some different
things. One was the &amp;#34;lab packet.&amp;#34; A self contained document with
instructions and partial walkthroughs. One of my classes is already
set up to do a number of labs in this way so that was an easy thing to
try.  Basically it ended up being an asynchronous experience with me
being available using the usual suspects - Slack and email. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried something different this past Monday. It was synchronous with
me available on Slack but we didn&amp;#39;t use Zoom. I set up a series of
videos. Each video was fairly short and most had a small assignment at
the end. I asked the class to fill out a form after each
video/assignment. The topic was binary trees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The whole process seemed to go well but I&amp;#39;ll report back once I&amp;#39;ve
finished going over the feedback emails I&amp;#39;ve gotten from the class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m particularly proud of this video that I made for the class, enjoy:
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s okay, I Get It</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/i-get-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 14:13:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/i-get-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was reading Mary Clair Wright&amp;#39;s new &lt;a href=&#34;https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; the other day. It&amp;#39;s always
great to see another teacher sharing publicly online.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One line caught my eye in her &lt;a href=&#34;https://computationalthinkinginroom112.com/2020/04/07/ap-csa-enrichment-gone-awry/&#34;&gt;latest post&lt;/a&gt; - 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
Remote instruction is weird, I can’t see them. I have to trust that they will message me with questions.
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a real problem. It&amp;#39;s hard enough in a regular class where we
can pick up an all sorts of cues and use all sorts formal and informal
assessments but when the students are on the other end of a
teleconference or even more challenging an email or chat it&amp;#39;s even
harder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also a reminder of how important those non verbal clues and
student feedback can be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s great if we can create an environment where our students will ask
for help if they don&amp;#39;t know something but even under normal
circumstances there&amp;#39;s the danger of students thinking they get
it. If a student is totally lost they&amp;#39;ll usually know they&amp;#39;re totally
lost but after that, it&amp;#39;s not so clear. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A student might think they get it if they can basically follow along
with what&amp;#39;s being presented. It&amp;#39;s pretty easy to watch another student
or a teacher go through explaining a solution step by step and think
you really know what&amp;#39;s going on. Similarly they can read through an
example in a text or on a web site and think they understand. A little
better is when they can do the first couple of problems in the book
but those frequently mimic the samples and don&amp;#39;t require any
additional insight. Even in a traditional class a student can go week
to week like this and really think they understand things and then
they get hit over the head on a test or right before a big assignment
is due. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t the student&amp;#39;s fault. It&amp;#39;s hard to know what you don&amp;#39;t know
and truth be told, we don&amp;#39;t really teach our students how to study and
self assess. It&amp;#39;s also really hard for teachers to assess this even in
person. Now that we&amp;#39;re all remote it&amp;#39;s yet another huge red flag to
look out for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No solutions here today and no suggestions just yet another concern as
we continue to work to do right by our kids.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Limitations Of Remote Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/limitations-of-remote-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 14:41:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/limitations-of-remote-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While tools like Zoom, Slack and others are a tremendous boon as we&amp;#39;re
forced to do all our teaching remotely the limitations become apparent
as we settle in and try to go beyond the basics of an offsite meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today was &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/code-review-2/&#34;&gt;code review&lt;/a&gt; day in my CS1 class. It&amp;#39;s a lesson that I enjoy
teaching and I think my students get a lot out of it. Today we had to
do it remote. The mechanics were largely the same:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pair off the kids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Have them write out a commentary on their partners code without discussion
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
pair off again
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Have one review the others code but this time via discussion and
note taking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get everyone together and discuss
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Zoom supported all the basics. Splitting the class was pretty easy via
the breakout room interface and students were able to flag me when
they wanted to bring me in to their breakout. It was also pretty easy
to move newcomers into a room. There were some interface nits that
Zoom has to address like how when I entered and left a breakout room I
ended up losing part of the breakout window interface but I figured
out a workaround.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big difference and limitation was that I couldn&amp;#39;t just lurk. In
a live in person class, I get a top down view. I can basically see what all the
pairs are doing. I can&amp;#39;t get the details from a distance but I can
basically see what&amp;#39;s going on. I can also sidle over near a group to
see how they&amp;#39;re doing without being obtrusive. I can also see some of
the students screens and notebooks to get the gist of what&amp;#39;s going on
and focus in on individual conversations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t do these things with Zoom and I daresay you can&amp;#39;t with any
remote conferencing platform. When I wasn&amp;#39;t in a breakout room I was
alone in the main room. When I was in a breakout room it was obvious I
joined and that in and of itself changed the room dynamic. I also
couldn&amp;#39;t see anything the kids were writing on paper or on screen
unless they explicitly shared it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this changes the dynamic big time and limits my effectiveness
as a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t take this to mean I&amp;#39;m down on Zoom. I&amp;#39;m really loving the tool
and without it or similar products my students would be getting &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; 
less during this crisis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s just a reminder that teaching is a contact sport and as much as
some people will tell you otherwise the best instruction is in person
in a small class with a knowledgeable dynamic teacher. We&amp;#39;re not
getting back there this semester but here&amp;#39;s hoping that we get back by
Fall.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s talk about something other than distance learning and COVID-19.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You know you&amp;#39;ve been doing something a long time when you&amp;#39;ve got
legends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over on my alumni mailing list JonAlf shared a web site showing off
what his current students were doing in their computer graphics
class. Somewhere in the thread, Con replied:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Someone should put up a video of the fabulous and fantastically famous
hand animation called FINGER.MDL. It dates from a little before my
time, but stories elevated it to legendary status.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Indeed it had reached legendary status. Other projects over the years
including Larry&amp;#39;s anatomically correct robot had also risen to
infamy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A little later in the thread the project&amp;#39;s author Josh chimed in and
shared his original source code. He still had it from May 1995. I&amp;#39;m
not entirely surprised - I had a copy of the code as well. The trouble
is it was written in Turbo-C on a DOS machine. Good luck compiling it
on a modern system. Fortunately, Josh was able to build and run the
project using an emulator. Check out the  marginally NSFW video at the
end of the post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the legend? Well, in addition to being a pretty terrific
project - particularly when you remember the horsepower it was running
on and that it was written by a student who was concurrently finishing
APCS, there&amp;#39;s a story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It starts in one of my APCS classes. Students were working on final
projects. Tom was working on Tetris - an impressive project for APCS
done in Turbo Pascal. Tom wanted to add music to the project and had a
clever way of doing it. Back then you could get basic sounds by
turning on and off the speaker at certain frequencies. Tom had two
arrays, one with frequencies and one with durations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Something like: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;notes&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;440&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;523&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;440&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;659&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;]
durations&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then for the game loop
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#+begin_src python&lt;/span&gt;

  current_note&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  note &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; notes[current_note]
  duration &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; durations[current_note]
  play(note) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# starts the note playing until you change or stop it&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; game_not_over:
      duration &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; duration &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; duration &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;:
          current_note &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; (current_note&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;length(notes)
          note &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; notes[current_note]
          duration &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; durations[current_note]
          play(note) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# starts the note playing until you change or stop it&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# the rest of the game loop&lt;/span&gt;
  stop_playing() &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# stop the speaker&lt;/span&gt;

    

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, he had to figure out all the frequencies and durations for
&amp;#34;Korobeiniki,&amp;#34; the tetris song. The class was more than happy to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Everyone&amp;#39;s working to help figure this out for Tom. It&amp;#39;s all pretty
cool when in walks Jinx Perullo - Stuy&amp;#39;s new principal along with the
President of the New York City Board of Education. The President&amp;#39;s jaw
drops as she hears a cacophony of Tetris music and screen after screen
of Tetris being played!!!!! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jinx makes an abrupt about face and drags the dignitary out of the
room. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward a week or so. We&amp;#39;re in the graphics class at the end of
the day - it was held during an non-existent after school period so
that the students could attend. Josh&amp;#39;s working on his graphics program
at a computer by the door.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jinx walked in again. This time with the school&amp;#39;s chancelor to be
greeted by:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ca_8q3ct6J4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once again, a quick about face.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For some reason Jinx never brought important people to my classes
again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Those were indeed the good old days.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Necessity is the mother of invention</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/mother-of-invention/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:59:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/mother-of-invention/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t expect to read a Fred Wilson post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://avc.com/2020/03/teaching-online/&#34;&gt;teaching online&lt;/a&gt; but
that&amp;#39;s what I found when I visited &lt;a href=&#34;https://avc.com/&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Don&amp;#39;t get me
wrong - I suspect that Fred has the makings of a great teacher, it&amp;#39;s
just not what I expected to find. There have been many posts about
education but I don&amp;#39;t recall any about teaching or more specifically
the art of teaching. I did find &lt;a href=&#34;https://avc.com/2011/07/teaching/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; though which actually speaks
to some of the thoughts today&amp;#39;s post got churning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fred describes what sounds like a typical &amp;#34;lecture style&amp;#34; lesson he&amp;#39;s
delivered numerous times. This time, it would be delivered via
Zoom. Now, Zoom is great but it&amp;#39;s harder to do an interactive
lecture - ie active learning online than it is to do in person which
is what I&amp;#39;m guessing led him to set up some starter Google sheets and
use these shared documents for an active project based class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the post, now that he came up with what sounds like
a much stronger approach. Fred wonders if he&amp;#39;ll ever teach this class
any other way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing I thought was that this would be even better in
person. I don&amp;#39;t know the specifics but I could think of a number of
ways of running this. All in person with time to work on the
spreadsheets is one. Giving some pre-work and the sheets and then pick
up somewhere in the middle is another. In person gives the feel - the
live interaction where a teacher can read the class but there&amp;#39;s no
reason why we can&amp;#39;t also leverage tech tools like shared Google
sheets in a live classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then I got thinking about necessity being the mother of
invention. Nothing stops us from changing things up, from trying
something in normal times but when the norm is disrupted sometimes it
spurs creativity or changes focus. I
try to continually evolve as a teacher but I&amp;#39;m no better than anyone
else and get caught in ruts. I force myself to try new
things. Sometimes they work and it&amp;#39;s great and sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/try-something-new/&#34;&gt;they
don&amp;#39;t&lt;/a&gt;. Live and learn. On the other hand, when all if a sudden you can&amp;#39;t do things the
usual way the brain works on alternatives. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One example was the lesson where I
&amp;#34;invented&amp;#34; live coding. It was a direct result of a forced change -
for some reason, and I don&amp;#39;t recall why, I couldn&amp;#39;t do things the way I
wanted that day so I winged it. Years later, I was chatting with a
former student and he, out of the blue mentioned that that lesson had
a profound influence on him. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, I&amp;#39;m teaching using Zoom, slack, videos and email. Not being
in a room with my kids sucks. I feel less connected and it&amp;#39;s much
harder to read the class. What am I doing? On the one hand, I&amp;#39;m not
trying to change that much at once as I want my students to have some
stability in an uncertain time but I am working on new things. The
nice thing is that whatever I come up with I can share with my fellow
teachers here and take with me back into the classroom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was my big takeaway but the post also reminded me of why I turn
to teachers before I turn to &amp;#34;the research&amp;#34; or policy makers on how to
teach. Fred described the evolution of a lesson and a teaching
technique. What he essentially described is what teachers do every day
and we have to do it accounting for all the variables that the
research can&amp;#39;t. We teach multiple classes a day every day of the
week. We try things, assess the results, rinse and repeat. I get that
all teachers don&amp;#39;t do this but the good ones do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final thought I had was with the reality that while coming up with
interesting active learning experiences is great it also takes a lot
of time and there&amp;#39;s not much time when you&amp;#39;re teaching five classes a
day five days a week to 150 kids along with grading, advising, and
everything else. This is why I tell young teachers that you always
want to evolve and improve but not every lesson is going to be a home
run and that&amp;#39;s okay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s particularly important for teachers to remember this now as
across the nation they&amp;#39;re re-inventing their syllabi on the fly to
move from in person to online and they&amp;#39;re doing it without time,
training, and in some cases tools. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do the best you can and continue to develop your toolset. Not every
new online experience will be great but if they&amp;#39;re sincere, your kids
will know. In the end we&amp;#39;ll all be okay and back to normal but with a
whole bunch of new tricks up our sleeves.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interesting Problems</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/interesting-problems/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 08:12:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/interesting-problems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I organize a monthly professional development session for CS
teachers. It&amp;#39;s targeted at teachers who are beyond the beginner stage
and don&amp;#39;t want yet another hello world blinky arduino scratch
workshop. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, given the need for CS teachers we need
plenty of beginner workshops but we also need to take teachers to the
next level. I refer to my workshops as being for teachers of APCS-A,
similar, or beyond. Participants get three hours of CTLE credit and
thanks to our gracious hosts at &lt;a href=&#34;http://digitalocean.com&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; get to use a great space
and enjoy a free meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I particularly enjoyed last weeks workshop for two reasons. One is
that we talked about &amp;#34;interesting problems.&amp;#34; This in itself is
interesting because different teachers find different things
interesting. For me, this time around, I was thinking of problems that
could be approached by beginners but had some interesting insight that
allowed them to look at the problem differently and solve it more
efficiently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second reason I liked this session is because I wasn&amp;#39;t the only
one presenting!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started the session talking about the Happy Ladybugs problem - a
Hackerrank problem I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/happy_ladybug/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then passed off to Justin who talked about finding the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull&#34;&gt;convex hull&lt;/a&gt;
bounding a set of points. Justin talked about how you can relate this
abstract geometry problem to real world problems like bounding
neighborhoods as well as how this can be graphically motivated and
then moved to discussing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms&#34;&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. Students can pretty easily come
up with a in inefficient O(n^4) solution and then Justin talked about
incrementally guiding them through alternate solutions ending with
something that runs in O(nlgn). At the end of the day we had a problem
that could be done in a variety of ways with students at different
levels of experience. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then moved to Barry&amp;#39;s presentation of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baphl.org/20/&#34;&gt;puzzle hunt&lt;/a&gt; problem he
adapted. It involved decoding, translation, number bases and Barry
uses it as a platform to work with stacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finished the evening talking about three problems but we didn&amp;#39;t look
at solutions. These were teasers for next time when we also hope to do a
SIGCSE recap.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers - part 2 - the report</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:03:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Continuing from yesterday, what about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on pay
and free teacher resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came
up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their bottom line conclusion was that &amp;#39;Overall, reviewers rate most
of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.&amp;#39; They
also didn&amp;#39;t seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources
were universally better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The one thing I can agree with though is that a consistent rating
system for the types of resources found on these sites would be very
helpful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think the main problem with the report has to do with what they were
looking for. They concluded things like the resources didn&amp;#39;t line up
well with standards, didn&amp;#39;t have good assessments, didn&amp;#39;t address
cultural diversity and a few other &amp;#34;didn&amp;#39;t dos,&amp;#34;  As I said, I think they
missed the point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It felt to me that the reviewers were looking for rote
experiences. Download a lesson and follow the script.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In spite of what reformers would have you think, that isn&amp;#39;t
teaching. A teacher new to a class might start with a well worked out
curriculum and largely follow it verbatim but as they develop their
chops they&amp;#39;ll want the curriculum and all related materials to become
their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A downloaded resource, taken as is, will likely not address a specific
classes cultural diversity, at least not more than in the general
sense because it was designed for the authors class and that&amp;#39;s a good
thing. It&amp;#39;s up to the person doing the downloading to take the
resource and then adapt it for their students in their situation. This
is why most of the items that the report considers bad to me are both
inevitable and fine. There is no universal lesson that you can cut and
paste to all schools. To expect it is rubbish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the CS side, there&amp;#39;s a good amount of sharing of materials as well
as providers well, providing content. Some is free some not but there
is a lot available. Forgetting about whole curricula resources, three
lesson / experience sites  I&amp;#39;m
reasonably familiar with are the SIGCSE &lt;a href=&#34;http://nifty.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Nifty Assignments&lt;/a&gt; and now the
CSTA&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/cstaniftyassignments/&#34;&gt;corresponding project&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engage-csedu.org/&#34;&gt;Engage CS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest problem with the Nifty sites is that they&amp;#39;re arranged
chronologically by the conference year they were presented. There are
no tags nor easy way to search.  Engage CS gives you some level of
searching like for course level, keyword, resource type, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sites present resources in a format that&amp;#39;s superficially
 consistent but the truth is, once you get past the headings they can
 be written up in radically different ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, that&amp;#39;s not a problem. Each resource was written by some
educator with the intent of sharing but since each author is unique so
to will be the content they produce. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The real value of all these resources are to get ideas - lesson
motivations, code samples, project ideas etc.. Sure, I wish they were
more discoverable via search - better tagged and yes, even better
rated but the value is from reading what some other teacher has done
and then pulling out aspects that can work for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve rarely used a Nifty Assignment nor something from EngageCS
explicitly but I have gotten value from both sites (CSTA Nifty
assignments are newer and I&amp;#39;ve been at all the CSTA sessions so
haven&amp;#39;t actually used the site). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I ever use a resources &amp;#34;as published?&amp;#34; Perhaps - if
it was really well aligned with how I do things. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Would I pay? Probably not. I&amp;#39;m not against paying for resources from a
philosophical point of view. Charge a fair price and give a reasonable
assurance that what you&amp;#39;re selling has value and provide some value
beyond the free sites. I haven&amp;#39;t used Teachers Pay Teachers and
probably won&amp;#39;t look at Amazon&amp;#39;s thing when it&amp;#39;s launched but to me,
they would have to bring value in terms of curation and search. If
they do at a fair price, then they may be worth using.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I started teaching there was no public internet. None of this
existed. Teachers kept binders or books of lesson plans and if you
were lucky you could borrow from a friend or colleague. New York&amp;#39;s DOE
at one point had a few teachers in each subject area submit lesson
plans for &amp;#34;lesson books&amp;#34; which they published for each core
subject. My chairman wrote some of the math ones and those materials
largely got me through my first year. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we have an embarrassment of riches. That comes with the price
that we have to actually read and evaluate all of the materials we&amp;#39;re
presented with but I&amp;#39;ll take today&amp;#39;s resources over what I started with
any day.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers  - part 1 - should they</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 08:43:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-pay-teachers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced
an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&amp;#39;t a new
concept - on the pay side, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/?msclkid=a426c2c1625613061bc19ce4cdcb6a0a&amp;amp;utm_source=bing&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Search%2520-%2520Branded%2520-%2520Desktop&amp;amp;utm_term=teachers%2520pay%2520teachers&amp;amp;utm_content=Brand%2520Name&#34;&gt;Teachers Pay Teachers&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a
while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but
they&amp;#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz?
Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should
they be providing them for free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to blog about it then but never got around to it The other
day, someone posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtech.com/computing/Report-Most-Teacher-Created-Online-English-Materials-Subpar.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article which questioned the quality of both
free resources and pay ones. The article, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/supplemental-curriculum-bazaar&#34;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; by the
Fordham Institute looked at ELA resources. The report also only looked
at Teachers Pay Teachers and two free sites - ReadWriteThink and Share
My Lesson excluding many other teacher resources that could be, for
all we know, better curated and more discoverable. As an aside, I was
turned off by the reports referring to their evaluators as &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;
which is a description I personally would question. Still, there&amp;#39;s
some good fodder for thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll get to the report in the next post but for now let&amp;#39;s tackle the
question that started the initial buzz - should teachers be charging
each other for materials?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It depends. If you&amp;#39;re paid by a school to develop materials they
belong to the school. In NY you can take a sabbatical to build a
course so anything you build during that time would be DOE property
and therefore you couldn&amp;#39;t sell it. Same thing if you&amp;#39;re being paid
off hours to develop materials. The gray area comes when you&amp;#39;re lesson
planning. Most real planning and development happens outside of
school hours. In an typical school day teacher are typically
allocated around 40 minutes to do all their planing, grading,
and paperwork so realistically most materials as well as planing,
paperwork, and grading are done off hours. This being the case, I&amp;#39;m of
the belief that those materials belong to the teacher (although I&amp;#39;ve
met some DOE educrats who would disagree).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, should they sell it? Well, they have every right to. That said, my
personal feelings and practice is that if you&amp;#39;ve developed something
for yourself and have not spent extra time or effort to prepare it for
others then I think you should make it freely available to your
peers. On the other hand, if you spend extra time and effort to make
it useful for and usable by others then by all means charge if you&amp;#39;d
like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll tackle the report in the next post and we&amp;#39;ll look at some of the
resources available on the CS side.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teacher Centric Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:27:09 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-centric-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new
 &lt;del&gt;teaching fad&lt;/del&gt; research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are
 trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits
 all. If we do, we&amp;#39;re good teachers, if we don&amp;#39;t we get the dreaded
 ineffective on our annual ratings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded of this when reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial&#34;&gt;Mark Guzdial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s recent blog post on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/01/13/computing-education-lessons-learned-from-the-2010s-what-i-got-wrong/&#34;&gt;things he got wrong&lt;/a&gt; in Computing Education. It&amp;#39;s a really great
post. Mark mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)&#34;&gt;constructivism&lt;/a&gt; and it made me think of a few
years ago when constructivism was all the rage. If you didn&amp;#39;t set your
class up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning&#34;&gt;discovery learning&lt;/a&gt; all the time you were clearly a bad
teacher. I&amp;#39;d sit on on CS PD sessions, listen to principals and
supervisors talk about what they wanted to see in classes and on and
on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you weren&amp;#39;t a constructivist educator you weren&amp;#39;t a good educator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course a few years earlier it was something else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back when I started it was cooperative learning and
cooperative learning isn&amp;#39;t just group work - you had to follow the
formula. Each student in a group had a role, there were specific
stages of work and everything had to be just so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There were other fads along the way. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you were lucky and had a good supervisor you didn&amp;#39;t have to worry
about the fads, the research, the nonsense. You could focus on your
development as a teacher. They might work with you on questioning, for
instance - regardless of the flavor of the month, a teacher will ask
questions and facilitate discussion and they will surely insulate you
from whatever nonsense the bean counters want to see as long as you&amp;#39;re
doing right by your students. On the other hand, a bad supervisor
would mean stressful set up observations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even without Mark&amp;#39;s post, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this a lot since
we&amp;#39;re about to launch our CS Teacher Certification programs at
Hunter so I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about these fads from a teacher
preparation point of view. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of these fads have some value - they&amp;#39;re tools in the toolbelt to
be used as needed. The problem is that supervisors, and in my
experience, professional development and teacher preparation programs
make teaching 100% about the student. While the student is in fact the
customer and who&amp;#39;s development is the goal of our work, you can&amp;#39;t
ignore other factors. Environment and resources are two of these other
factors and a big one is the teachers individual strengths,
weaknesses, and tendencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cooperative Learning never really worked for me - at least not whole
hog. As a &amp;#34;Cooperative Learning teacher&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;d be meh at best. On the
other hand, I&amp;#39;ve taken plays from the cooperative learning playbook
and applied them as I&amp;#39;ve seen useful. Sometimes it didn&amp;#39;t work,
sometimes to great effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, I always took the advice of one of my early fencing
mentors. I was receiving conflicting advice from multiple well
respected coaches and more experienced fencers. My mentor said &amp;#34;listen
to what they all have to say, think about it, figure out what best
will work for you and do that.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to running my teacher prep programs, I&amp;#39;m going to do my best to
make sure that we do recognize that teachers bring different things to
the table and it will my job to help them maximize their
effectiveness. This means that we can&amp;#39;t blindly follow the favored
teaching techniques du jour but rather we have to look at all sorts of
methods and combine them with our teachers strengths, abilities, and
tendencies, and their specific classroom situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It should be fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using GitHub issues for class communicatoin</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/git-issues/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week I talked about using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/communicating-with_students/&#34;&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt; as a mechanism for class
communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and
also felt that a video would be better than text.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class
communication. I don&amp;#39;t show examples of everything like @ tagging but
I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub
classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Enjoy.

      <title>What Is Good Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/what-is-good-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 17:13:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/what-is-good-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I had a conversation with my principal during my last year at
Stuy. She said &amp;#34;whenever the superintendent or high level education
people come and ask to see our best teachers I can never bring them to
Jim&amp;#39;s class.&amp;#34; Everyone knows that Jim is the best. I describe him as
&amp;#34;the teacher I aspire to be.&amp;#34;  What&amp;#39;s the problem? The problem is that
Jim didn&amp;#39;t teach the way the powers that be wanted him to teach. He
didn&amp;#39;t do discovery learning, kids didn&amp;#39;t work in groups, there&amp;#39;s
typically nothing that you could check off on the &amp;#34;best way to teach&amp;#34;
list. Jim&amp;#39;s an old school teacher. Teacher dominant. He leads the
discussion, asks questions, circulates while the kids work on
problems etc. Why does it work? A combination of things. He know his
math, charisma, force of personality, empathy, and a lot of other
factors. One could dismiss it as saying &amp;#34;it&amp;#39;s Stuy, it&amp;#39;s easy&amp;#34; but he
was the best at a high needs school before he was the best at Stuy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about this for a few reasons. One is I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=52&amp;amp;t=0s&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
video by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Felienne&#34;&gt;Felienne Hermans&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a good video, many good points. I
particularly like when she talked about talking to a room of teachers
about a new &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; about learning only to find that teachers have
known it for decades. Basically, Felienne pushes back on the discovery
learning and let them play that&amp;#39;s dominated the CS Education
space. She talks about her success with direct instruction. Another is
that we&amp;#39;re starting to see more acceptance and voices for
direct instruction in the CS Ed space as a whole. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I think this is a good thing, after all, it&amp;#39;s more my
style. On the other hand, I don&amp;#39;t want the pendulum to swing too
far. I was talking to a history teacher at Stuy when they brought in
the Danielson &lt;del&gt;nonsense&lt;/del&gt; Framework. She&amp;#39;s a good teacher but she was
sheepish about Danielson. She said that Danielson worked for her - it
aligned with the way she taught and made her seem like the absolute
best. She was and is an excellent teacher but we all have holes in our
game. She didn&amp;#39;t want to be held  up as an exemplar of great teaching
where she knew that chances are there will be a successor to Danielson
and chances are something else will be in vogue and she won&amp;#39;t be so
officially terrific anymore. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, direct instruction is coming back. Who knows if it will
become the darling of the policy makers but regardless, a teaching
style or technique&amp;#39;s value can&amp;#39;t be determined without considering
other factors. The teacher&amp;#39;s personal style, the students, the
resources, class time, and much more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what is a teacher to do? Add all the tools to your toolbox. I&amp;#39;m
not big on cooperative learning but I&amp;#39;ve peppered it in now and
then. Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s best to have the students discover things,
something you&amp;#39;ve got to tell them. Sometimes they should work on
things solo, sometimes in teams. I&amp;#39;ve taught classes that were all
projects and classes that had limited projects. Acquire all the tools
and use them as YOU think best. It&amp;#39;s the teacher with the skin in the
game. Not the policy makers, thought leaders, researchers, and
influences. More importantly it&amp;#39;s the teacher that knows their
students best - where they are, what they need and how to do the best
they can given the limited resources they have. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m obviously not excusing teachers who do one side lectures or who
just phone it in but the majority of teachers work hard to do it right
and should be given the freedom to do just that.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Scripts To Freestyle</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/from-scripts-to-freestyle/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:35:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/from-scripts-to-freestyle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I just read &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@bethanymarz/going-off-script-b69345fc5904&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bethanymarz&#34;&gt;Bethany Crystal&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@bethanymarz/going-off-script-b69345fc5904&#34;&gt;Going off script&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bethany writes that while she normally essentially scripts important
presentations, this time she went more off the cuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It made me think about how I teach and a disturbing trend I&amp;#39;ve
seen in CS education and education in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never strictly used a script for teaching. When I started I did
use &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; detailed lesson plans. Back then I was teaching math. It
was also pre internet or at least pre internet as we now know
it. I had an account on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.panix.com/&#34;&gt;Panix&lt;/a&gt; and the internet did indeed exist but
you couldn&amp;#39;t just look for teaching materials. I actually remember
bringing a modem in to Seward Park one day and showing a bunch of kids
this up and coming thing called the internet. I showed them usernet
news, a gopher server and a couple of other things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of teaching materials, you could buy sample lesson plans from
the teacher store near the Board of Ed in Brooklyn. These were books
that were compilations of mostly handwritten lessons. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I basically copied and modified them. I had an &lt;strong&gt;aim&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;do now&lt;/strong&gt; key
questions were written as were definitions and summary
statements. Of course there were numerous sample problems and
exercises, all worked out
in advance. It wasn&amp;#39;t quite a script but it was a very well fleshed
out guide 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I gained experience and also shifted from math which wasn&amp;#39;t my
passion to CS, my plans become sparser. I&amp;#39;d still write down
definitions, maybe some solutions and a list of key points but a lot
of the particulars were gone. I didn&amp;#39;t write out key questions or
solutions to all the problems in advance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As time went by the plans got sparser still. I&amp;#39;d still list the key
points I&amp;#39;d want to cover as well as notes on tricky parts of the
lesson but more often than not I&amp;#39;ll just go in with a bullet list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s my plan for a recent lesson:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Go over cipher soution
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to we solve if already ciphered?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rotate 26 times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about using stats
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Frequency of letters - look up
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Find freq of letter in string then use distance formula against
model
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get frequencies from a book
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
try it in another language
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We didn&amp;#39;t get to the last two bullet items so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ll start
off on Monday. This plan was all I needed but it in no way tells the
full story of the lesson to anyone but me. It doesn&amp;#39;t include the
motivation, ancillary stories and materials nor how the lesson was
developed or delivered. I knew how it would play out because I was
teaching it and for me these notes were more than sufficient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this is not to say that I don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time planning my
lessons. I do. I just don&amp;#39;t create detailed scripts. I know what I
want to cover and how I want to cover it. Then it&amp;#39;s just got to the
class and go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A big advantage of this is something that Bethany mentioned in her
piece - the ability to &amp;#34;read the room.&amp;#34; This is a big part of
teaching. If you&amp;#39;re following a script, you&amp;#39;re not reading the room
and you&amp;#39;re probably not really teaching the class. You might be
following a script but your students certainly aren&amp;#39;t and once they
veer off program you&amp;#39;ve got to abandon your script or you&amp;#39;re not doing
right by the class. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having a direction but not a script makes it easier to &amp;#34;call and
audible.&amp;#34; That&amp;#39;s what led me to teach the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/who-played-spiderman/&#34;&gt;question answering system&lt;/a&gt;
lesson the other day. It was unplanned but as a class we were having a
discussion and that&amp;#39;s where it led.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned, when I started out I couldn&amp;#39;t do this. I needed much
more detailed plans. That said, as a teacher gains more experience
they can better connect to their classes and do more for their
students by not sticking to the script, reading the room and adapting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to that trend that disturbing trend. I&amp;#39;m talking about
pushing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/30/teacher-slams-scripted-common-core-lessons-that-must-be-taught-word-for-word/?utm_term=.6afd6d64f1c6&#34;&gt;scripted lessons&lt;/a&gt;. These crop up in charter schools and no
excuse environments and are typically used as ways of &amp;#34;compensating&amp;#34;
for teachers that don&amp;#39;t really know the subject area or how to teach
and to standardize teaching. To me it&amp;#39;s an attack on the teaching
profession. A script is great for a play. It&amp;#39;s great for a speech and
for some presentations but not for teaching. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I understand having something that&amp;#39;s more scripted to use when you&amp;#39;re
faced with novice teachers or teachers that are new to a subject area
but I fear that at times the scripted lessons are the end game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was talking to a friend a few years ago. He&amp;#39;s doing great work in the
CS Ed space and among other things, he develops curricula. I mentioned
to him that I loved his work (still do) but I was concerned that his
materials were becoming much more scripted. His reply was something
like &amp;#34;I agree with you in theory but the truth is most teachers aren&amp;#39;t
you.&amp;#34; I understood his point as most of the teachers that used his
materials were novices but I disagreed that they were &amp;#34;not me.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m
nothing special. I&amp;#39;m just a reasonably bright guy who works hard at
his craft. If I can teach script free so can anyone. Maybe not at
first, but certainly after time and we subvert our profession by
settling for less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a final note, at this point in my career I actually find it very
hard to use a script - even for a presentation. Over the last couple
of years, I&amp;#39;ve been spending my Falls visiting high schools to talk
about Hunter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://info.huntercs.org&#34;&gt;Honors CS&lt;/a&gt; program. As much as I tried, I couldn&amp;#39;t
script a presentation. No matter what I did, when I got in front of
the students I just ended up doing my thing and talking to them. At
the end of the day I ended up working things backwards. Over my first
few school visits, I developed a set of key points that I kept coming
back to and finally ended up with a list of bullet points that I can
pretty much follow when I do the &amp;#34;navigating from high school to
college in tech&amp;#34; talk. I guess I&amp;#39;m now working in reverse. Starting
free style and working back to a script.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Globals Breaks And Returns, oh my</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/globals-breaks-and-returns/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 15:48:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/globals-breaks-and-returns/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Never use global variables
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Never break out of a loop
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are two &amp;#34;best practices&amp;#34; that are frequently touted in early CS
classes both at the high school and college level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They came up a couple of times yesterday. Once in the Facebook APCS-A
teachers group and once on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2018/10/if-you-are-using-global-variables-you.html&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alfred post was topically on global variables. Actually it was deeper than just global
variables. It&amp;#39;s also about how students progress - what they can figure
out at various stages of progress and how what seems like a good idea
early on the path to computer science doesn&amp;#39;t seem so great later on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The discussion on the APCS-A group started with a discussion of this
code and its &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement as opposed to having the loop&amp;#39;s exit
condition in the boolean up top:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// do stuff
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;condition&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These two &amp;#34;best practices&amp;#34; - not using globals and not breaking out of
loops are frequently taught to students at a point when reasons for
the best practice aren&amp;#39;t always clear. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, these aren&amp;#39;t even universally best practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking at the while loop, You might have event driven code with a
while loop acting as a dispatcher:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-java&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// do stuff
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;some event&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; that event&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;some other event&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; that event&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// etc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;exit event&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nothing wrong with that structure. It&amp;#39;s clean, easy to read and easy
to reason about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve seen loops that use extra variables and crazy boolean expressions
so as to avoid using a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement so that they follow the &amp;#34;best
practice&amp;#34; but end up with much messier code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that you should always use &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; for that matter but rather that the best practice should be to
consider if it makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and more
maintainable or not. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the global front things are also not so clear. Sure, storing
information in globals  and then using them indiscriminantly in
assorted methods or functions is both bad form and dangerous but there
are times when using globals make sense. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in &amp;#34;the day&amp;#34; I was a C programmer. I used single C source files
along with their matching .h include files to enable &lt;strong&gt;object typed&lt;/strong&gt;
programming. Each file was a singleton object. Functions in the file
were methods using some naming convention to demarcate public vs
private, and variables that were global to the file as class variables
(or instance variables but there was only ever one instance of any
given class). Technically I broke the rules but the technique was very
effective and allowed me to write large maintainable systems. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More recently I&amp;#39;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; for front end
development. Vue uses a central data store - Vuex to maintain
state. Basically a place for global variables to manage the state of
your application. Again, technically global but with rules and
protocols to make things work without the usual danger associated with
globals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A great comment on the Facebook thread &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; included this Hal
Ableson quote:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and noted that this is particularly true on the AP Exam and after all,
the original question was posed on a forum about APCS-A. With this in
mind, you shouldn&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to use globals or cleverly or creatively 
use &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; but they do have their places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve used globals in both professional and personal work when
appropriate and I don&amp;#39;t shy away from &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; and use
them regularly. The real &lt;strong&gt;best practice&lt;/strong&gt; is that you consider why you
are or aren&amp;#39;t using these constructs and make a choice that makes
sense for you, your group, or your team. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-reference-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-body&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I will identify sources when they publish content publicly on ablog or Twitter, since
the Facebook group is semi-private, I don&amp;#39;t feel it&amp;#39;s appropriate to
state the names of commenters without asking]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Not every lesson has to be magic</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/not-always-exciting/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:08:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/not-always-exciting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
If you check out Twitter, Facebook, Medium  and other blog sites you
might get the idea that you&amp;#39;re the worst teacher in the world. The
internet abounds with people sharing tweets and posts about wonderful
lessons they&amp;#39;ve just taught, witnessed or learned about in
professional development. Sure, the teacher forums rife with requests
for lesson ideas and resources but the shared material is always aces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It makes sense, people in the community want to share things that
worked for them or things they think will work. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, for new teachers it can create an unhealthy illusion of what
really goes on in the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is not to say that sharing of the good stuff is a bad thing but
the truth is that not every lesson is a masterpiece, not every teacher
is a super charismatic showman, and not all topics lend themselves to
creative teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why am I writing this now? Because I was planning lessons earlier
today and I&amp;#39;m at one of those places where I&amp;#39;m not going to be able to
deliver a whiz-bang lesson in my next class. One of my classes this
semester is for beginners so we&amp;#39;re building up language skills from
the ground up. Right now I want to do some loop applications but
there&amp;#39;s only so much we can do given what the students know. There are
reasons why I don&amp;#39;t want to do graphics with them right now. I also
haven&amp;#39;t introduced lists yet and don&amp;#39;t want to loop over strings yet
so I&amp;#39;m left with doing mathy stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think I&amp;#39;ll look at Newton&amp;#39;s method for square roots. It&amp;#39;s
interesting for the math inclined and does let us explore issues with
floating point and accuracy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not going to be super exciting for everyone though and that&amp;#39;s okay. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could do lists first but I don&amp;#39;t want the kids to have to handle so
much new material so quickly. I&amp;#39;d rather keep the pace slower and work
with what they&amp;#39;ve just learned for a bit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could also do graphics but that adds a level of overhead I don&amp;#39;t
want to get into now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is to look at the long game. A class runs a whole semester or
possibly a year. You&amp;#39;re going to have some special memorable lessons
and some mundane ones and that&amp;#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re still mostly going to see best practices shared online with only
a few brave souls sharing disaster classes and asking for help. That&amp;#39;s
just how the internet works. It&amp;#39;s not the worst thing in the
world. Just remember when you&amp;#39;re struggling to come up with a good
lesson or you&amp;#39;ve just taught a bad one that tomorrow&amp;#39;s will be
better. Judge yourself by your students long term development, not one
day at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PD for people who know CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pd-for-cs/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/pd-for-cs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I saw a couple of tweets from Sarah Judd this morning:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A lot of CS Ed PD assumes you are new to CS. I really want CS Ed PD for people like us that came from a CS background and want to understand the pedagogy for CS in particular better. Do you know of some?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah Judd (@SarahEJudd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd/status/1011785286693552139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Yes! I love SIGCSE and CSTA. I just feel like... Math teachers don&amp;#39;t get PD that starts with &amp;quot;and this is how you add and subtract!&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;d love more CS PD that assumes the content is there, and can focus on the pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sarah Judd (@SarahEJudd) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SarahEJudd/status/1011966102795059200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard this refrain. Last year I attended
my first CSTA conference. I had numerous conversations with CS
teachers on the fact that everything was on an intro level in terms of
both content and teaching. Further conversations with local teachers
with stronger CS backgrounds led me to run a professional development
session at Hunter this past election day for more experienced CS
teachers at schools that offered more than the basics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While it&amp;#39;s not surprising that most of the PD opportunities for CS teachers are
rather rudimentary given that nationally most programs are new and
most teachers are new to the subject but there are a few deeper
reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, there are big players in the CS Ed movement that are pushing
curricula and specific programs and that leads to scripted PD for
their products and not depth of knowledge nor deep pedagogical content
knowledge let alone basic pedagogy. Add to this the fact that many of
the &amp;#34;thought leaders&amp;#34; in the space don&amp;#39;t have experience teaching CS
at the K12 level and in many cases don&amp;#39;t have a background either in
teaching nor tech and you can see where the problem comes from. On top
of this we have the erosion of respect for teaching as a profession
where reformers are trying to take the teacher out of teaching and are
trying to reduce pedagogy to following scripts. This problem goes well
beyond CS Ed but as the new kid on the block it probably hits us
hardest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, preparing beginners is both necessary and appropriate for
the time being but we can and must do a better job than what&amp;#39;s
currently &amp;#34;state of the art.&amp;#34; At the same time we have to do something
with the CS teachers who indeed do have strong content knowledge but
don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with imparting that knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what should we do?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For new teachers the solution will ultimately have to come
from pre-service programs but what we end up getting is going to
largely be dictated on what&amp;#39;s required by individual states. If states
merely require passing an exam like the Praxis CS exam which, from
what I can gather isn&amp;#39;t a horrible content exam then we&amp;#39;re going to
see CS teachers bumble through their early to mid careers while trying
to figure out how to teach CS much like I did way back when. If they
end up endorsing pre-service programs that are focused on specific
curricula - APCS-A for teachers, APCS-P for teachers, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/math-for-math-teachers/&#34;&gt;Math for Math
teachers&lt;/a&gt; if you will but for CS, we&amp;#39;re also not going to get strong
well prepared pedagogues. On the other hand if you can design a
program that has a strong pedagogical component to go along with the
content, you have a chance. Even with a well designed program
implementation will still be a challenge. Who will teach it? Education
professors who don&amp;#39;t have CS backgrounds? CS professors with little
pedagogical training? Neither of those groups necessarily have any
real experience as actual K12 teachers. If you can find honest to
goodness experienced, strong K12 CS teachers to teach your pedagogy
courses that&amp;#39;s a big win but that&amp;#39;s going to be hard in most cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think we designed a great program at Hunter and have a practical and
strong implementation plan. If you&amp;#39;re going to be
at CSTA2018 you can hear all about it and why we designed it as we did
in the talk I&amp;#39;m giving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the more experienced I don&amp;#39;t have a universal answer but I can say
what I&amp;#39;m planning. Teachers in NY have to complete 100 CTLE hours
every five years. For beginners, there are plenty of options, at least
content wise. For teachers who know CS, not so much. I was at a meetup
talking to a few friends a couple of weeks ago and one mentioned that
they get most of their hours in Math for America CS
workshops. Unfortunately more than a few of my CS teacher friends who
are in MFA tell me that the CS content in these workshops, while they
do satisfy the hours, are somewhat lacking on the CS / CS pedagogy
side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m planning - we (Hunter) will host a once a month
dinner/session for CS teachers who are a little farther along CS
wise. I haven&amp;#39;t worked out all the details yet but I&amp;#39;ve got a few tech
companies that are already interested in sponsoring and helping out
should we need anything and we&amp;#39;ll probably set most of our agenda for
the year at the first session where I&amp;#39;ll make my best guess at a
useful agenda. This is something I&amp;#39;m pretty excited about. It should
help create a network of more experienced CS teachers which will both
help bolster that segment of the community and provide a long term
resource to newcomers and it should be a lot of fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some ways, this is why I ended up joining Hunter. Regardless of
what the city and state do, we&amp;#39;re going to prepare the teachers and if
you have a well prepared teacher, you&amp;#39;ve got a shot.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tech or the Teacher</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tech-or-teacher/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/tech-or-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Every morning one of the first things I do is quickly glance at my
emails and other notifications. I really should wait until I&amp;#39;m more
awake but old habits die hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As some of you know over the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been making a
series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; and related post on using my editor of choice,
Emacs. I&amp;#39;ve done 48 videos, have over 2500 subscribers on
YouTube and people seem to find some value from the series.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning one of my emails was a new comment on one of my videos:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for not describing a single key combination and how that fits
into basic usage of org mode.  I was going to subscribe but if all
your videos are going to be about showing off how fast you are at
typing emacs commands on your annoyingly noisy keyborad, then no
thanks!﻿
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My first reaction was &amp;#34;you know, you could have said something like
&amp;#39;if you slow down an actually say the keys it would be much easier to
follow and would be more valuable&amp;#39; and it would be much better received&amp;#34; but
then I started to think about instructional videos in general. I
started to make these videos for my students. I thought they might be
helpful and then found that the Emacs community by and large liked
them. They&amp;#39;re not teaching anything deep or complicated just how I use
a programmable editor. Even so, I was reminded by this comment about
the limitations of videos and ed tech in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos provide some nice features - you can watch them at any time,
you can pause and replay, and in some cases you can watch at super
speeds. What you can&amp;#39;t do is slow the video down and most importantly
you can&amp;#39;t ask questions or interact with the instructor. You can leave
comments if the video is on a platform like YouTube but that&amp;#39;s pretty
limited.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if this was a class, we would have been able to
interact and I as the instructor would have had a much better chance
to make sure this &amp;#34;student&amp;#34; was up to speed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this wasn&amp;#39;t a class. I don&amp;#39;t have the time to teach tools
like Emacs in class and since it is a mechanical skill, it can be
offloaded to a video. The video has the ancillary benefit of living on
and being discoverable and viewable by the public at large. This is a
good thing. Videos are tech and tech scales. Unfortunately, good
education doesn&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Videos are tech and tech is the rage. Lots of people are working hard
to get more tech in front of our kids - usually at the expense of
having a great teacher. This is something we don&amp;#39;t need. Technology is
nice but I&amp;#39;d rather have my kids in a small class with a knowledgable
teacher and a piece of chalk than all the tech in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a computer science guy and a computer science teacher I think it&amp;#39;s
good to remind myself that tech is cool but a good teacher is way cooler.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Magic Bullets - Discovery Learning</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/no-magic-bullets-constructivism/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/no-magic-bullets-constructivism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &amp;#34;How do I assess CS?&amp;#34; I
wanted to go but it&amp;#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped
out. Fortunately, the meetup was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIMKAZbHAiA&amp;amp;index=83&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;t=1796s&#34;&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to watch the
first half this morning while working out on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staczero.com/hero&#34;&gt;stationary trainer&lt;/a&gt;
which leads me to today&amp;#39;s rare Saturday morning blog
post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12
teachers who taught CS. I can&amp;#39;t talk about the second panel yet since I&amp;#39;m
only halfway through but there were a couple of points made by my
friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KatieJergens&#34;&gt;Katie Jergens&lt;/a&gt; who teaches at Dalton that I thought were worth
talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first was when Katie noted that through working with the panel,
one of her takeaways was that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Giving students an explicit strategy for solving a problem - &amp;#34;this is
how I would do it….,&amp;#34; - giving them an explicit strategy first and then giving them a
problem for which that strategy would apply is much more effective than
having them discover it on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was refreshing to hear after being beaten over the head on
discovery learning and constructivism for the past five or so
years as being the magic bullet for teachers. I shared more thoughts
on this a few weeks ago when I wrote about a SIGCSE paper presented by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap World&lt;/a&gt; that I very much liked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Katie went on to talk about how the group found that while &amp;#34;discovery
learning&amp;#34; can be effective it can also be frustrating and lose kids
along the way. It also takes a lot of time and preparation, something
that&amp;#39;s short on supply in most public schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This made me think about the recent flurry
of discussion around the debunking of learning styles which had
previously been the magic bullet. When I started, the secret sauce was cooperative
learning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course any good teacher knows there&amp;#39;s no magic bullet. You fill
your tool belt and chest with as much as you can and use what&amp;#39;s
best based on your strengths as a teacher combined with what will work
best with your students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another point that Katie made that I found refreshing had to do with
something she does with her classes. A good portion of a student&amp;#39;s grade is
based on what she calls a &amp;#34;booster.&amp;#34; Each student has to work one on
one with her on some project. The student either scores a 0 or a 100 -
the student keeps working with the direct support of the teacher until
it&amp;#39;s perfect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The important thing that Katie said with respect to this is &amp;#34;I can
do this because my largest class is sixteen students.&amp;#34; No way could
this ever scale to a public school where a teacher can meet with over
150 students a day and barely has time eat lunch let alone
work one on one with a student in a suitably quiet place like an
office. The refreshing thing to hear was the acknowledgment of the
fact that what works in a rich private school won&amp;#39;t work in a public
school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All to often education and yes, CS Ed is driven by people who
really have no clue. They&amp;#39;re anointed as thought leaders but they
don&amp;#39;t walk the walk. Some have some knowledge and experience but many
don&amp;#39;t. Until you&amp;#39;ve gotten a few years under your belt in a strap
cashed public school that takes all comers, don&amp;#39;t tell them how they
should do it. Katie didn&amp;#39;t - she acknowledged the problem - too bad so
many others don&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m looking forward to watching the rest of the video during a future
workout and might have more to share then. For now, take a look for
yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Strong K12 Teacher Certification is Important</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/strong-teacher-certification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
About a week ago New York State&amp;#39;s new regulation creating a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180327/NEWS/180329893/new-york-will-finally-have-certified-computer-science-teachers&#34;&gt;K12 CS
teacher certification&lt;/a&gt; went live. Just the other day I was honored to be
interviewed by  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mflamm_reporter&#34;&gt;Matt Flamm&lt;/a&gt; of Crain&amp;#39;s New York in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180410/TECHNOLOGY/180419999/asked-answered-teacher-changed-jobs-to-push-for-new-york-states-new&#34;&gt;follow up piece&lt;/a&gt;
about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs
that lead to certification is &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;. In my view, it&amp;#39;s a game changer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s Focus on high school, my wheelhouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From a course offerings point of view it&amp;#39;s the wild west. I don&amp;#39;t mean
this as a bad thing, it&amp;#39;s just that there&amp;#39;s a huge range of offerings
from AP to home brew, physical computing, game based, cyber security,
you name it, there&amp;#39;s a curriculum. The long and short of this is that
schools need teachers to teach all of these experiences. Without a
strong certification pathway we&amp;#39;re going to be stuck with the current
training based model where teachers are trained to deliver canned
curricula rather than truly teach. With strong teacher preparation
programs teachers will be prepared not only to deliver all the
existing curricula but, arguable more importantly design their own
learning experiences appropriate for the populations they work with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is important and alone would make having CS certification
worthwhile but to me the BIG win is that it creates a viable career
path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People say we&amp;#39;ll never find enough CS teachers because the tech
industry pays so well. I&amp;#39;ve never believed that. We find math teachers
even though many could flee to finance and chem teachers in spite of
big pharma&amp;#39;s call so why can&amp;#39;t we find CS teachers? Because we&amp;#39;ve
never provided a path into the profession and a viable career track.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certification means that over time schools will be able to build CS
teachers and the discipline will be treated as the other
subjects. Prior to certification, a CS teacher might be cut if a
school&amp;#39;s math department downsized. With certification, the career
track for a CS teacher is the same as the track for any other teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It also means that young people starting out who are interested in
both teaching and computer science will have a way of getting into the
profession - something that has never before existed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having CS certification alone won&amp;#39;t woo a
plethora of current tech professionals into teaching but over time,
we&amp;#39;ll start to have CS Ed majors or CS majors pursuing CS ED Masters
degrees and entering the profession. This won&amp;#39;t happen in a press or
election cycle but it will happen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all hinges on quality prep programs. I think I&amp;#39;ve hit the sweet
spot with what I&amp;#39;ve designed at Hunter. The critical components are of
course content and pedagogy. Teacher candidates must have both
sufficient depth and breadth in the subject and all the pedagogical
content knowledge that comes along with it. I don&amp;#39;t agree with the
common approach of taking a course to teach a course - that is, having
courses like &amp;#34;APCS - Principles for teachers&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;APCS - A for
teachers.&amp;#34;  I want my teachers to be able to teach any reasonable
curriculum or design their own so we&amp;#39;ll be rolling out courses that
examine the commonly offerd curricula but prepare teachers for a whole
lot more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been an exciting week in NY CS Ed and there&amp;#39;s a lot more to come.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Refactoring</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/refactoring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are
rarely taught and given the chance to develop  good programming
practices. There&amp;#39;s usually not enough time. Beginners work on small
&amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; which don&amp;#39;t lend themselves to good software development
practices and later on, there&amp;#39;s so much other material like
algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and
learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;Make sure to comment your code..&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;Indent properly…&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;Use functions…&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s important to test your code…&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
so when I see an opportunity to use a simple example to drive home a
good practice,  I try to jump on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Drawing shapes with text is a typical early project. I&amp;#39;ve seen it in
text books and online and have been doing it for years. I recall doing
it back in the 80s in Fortran IV when the programs we wrote were on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card&#34;&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt;, run
overnight on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130&#34;&gt;IBM 1130&lt;/a&gt;, and printouts picked up the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s a nice use of nested loops. The students will write functions to
create assorted shapes out of asterisks  like rectangles and
triangles. Typical solutions look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34; data-lang=&#34;c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Which results in shapes like these:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;

| ****            |    | *               |
| ****            |    | **              |
| ****            |    | ***             |
| ****            |    | ****            |
| ****            |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
|                 |    |                 |
| *************** |    | *               |
| *************** |    | **              |
| *************** |    | ***             |
| *************** |    | ****            |
| *************** |    | *****           |
| *************** |    | ******          |
| *************** |    | *******         |
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there will be more interesting shapes including things like:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;

*       *            *****
**      ***           *   *            and more
***     *****          *   *
****      ***           *****
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a great time to talk about refactoring.  All of the shape
drawing functions follow the same pattern - there&amp;#39;s an outer loop for
the height and then one or more inner loops to draw each line. We can
factor out the inner loops in to a separate &lt;code&gt;line()&lt;/code&gt; function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34; data-lang=&#34;c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s just like factoring in algebra:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;latex-block&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(RectangleOuterLoop × Line) + (TriangleOuterLoop × Line) ⇒ Line  (Rectangleouterloop × TriangleOuterloop)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We end up with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34; data-lang=&#34;c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s simpler, cleaner, and also can lead us to thinking about the
&amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; shapes in an interesting way. Instead of looking at the right
justified triangle as a triangle, we can think of each level as two
lines - one of spaces (shown here as dashes) followed by a line of
stars:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
----*       *
---**      **
--***     ***
-****    ****
*****   *****
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Noticing that  for a height of 5, the dashed lines count down in
length 4,3,2,1,0 and the star lines count up 1,2,3,4,5, we get:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34; data-lang=&#34;c++&#34;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we have typical early CS assignment that really lends itself to
talking about structuring programs and refactoring. Where else can we
inject good programming practices in ways that make sense early on?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sigcse2018 Bootstrapworld on Creativity in CS classes</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse2018-bootstrap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I really didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159471&#34;&gt;Creativity, Customization,
and Ownership: Game Design in Bootstrap: Algebra&lt;/a&gt; session. I&amp;#39;ve been a
big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bootstrapworld.org/&#34;&gt;Bootstrep&lt;/a&gt; for years and looking at the authors, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/10/cs-teacher-interview-emmanuel.html&#34;&gt;Emmanuel
Schanzer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s been a freind forever. I&amp;#39;ve never met &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ShriramKMurthi&#34;&gt;Shriram Krishnamurthi&lt;/a&gt;
in person but am looking forward to it. We&amp;#39;ve traded emails and blog
comments. I&amp;#39;d like to consider him a friend and I certainly respect
him and his work even though we frequently disagree around the
edges. The third author and presenter, Kathi Fisler was new to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Bootstrap program is embedded in algebra classes. In it, students
use Racket (nee scheme) to reinforce math skills while building
computer science skills. The big student project is a graphical game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When designing the project, students are asked to decide on and find
four resources:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The background image
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The player image
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The target image
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enemy image
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Students are given a short amount of time to decide on and find these
four images. I think it was about ten minutes and that&amp;#39;s it. That&amp;#39;s
all the &amp;#34;creativity&amp;#34; in the assignment. After that, all the students
are essentially creating the same game with different skins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This design makes sense. You can&amp;#39;t have students going all over the
place. Constraining the assignment in this way allows teachers who
might now be strong in computer science to guide the kids through the
program to completion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the time I was thinking: I really like all of this but is it really
open ended creativity and discovery with respect to math or computer
science? As it turned out, Fisler addressed this point at the end of
the talk in a way that made me vary happy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fisler went on to describe the rest of the student experience and then
went on to talk about the statistics they gathered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One big takeaway was that while all the students were essentially
writing the same game varying only the graphical elements, this
encouraged students to create very different themes. They also created
rich stories around their games. The project might not have been
&amp;#34;creative&amp;#34; with respect to the CS or Math directions but it was certainly
creative in other important areas. The other takeaway was that
survey&amp;#39;s indicated all sorts of positives from the program as a whole
so the project didn&amp;#39;t seem to have suffered by having the students
essentially write the same program. Participants were proud of their
work, they felt their games were different from their peers and in
general the experience was good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During questions, someone asked about adding a fifth element - a
projectile or missile. It turns out that at one point the program had a
projectile component but that led to the vast majority of projects to
be themed in very similar ways. Even though not the same, it reminded me to something Randy
Pausch said in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&#34;&gt;Last Lecture&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You make whatever you want. Two rules: no shooting violence and no
pornography. Not because I’m opposed to those in particular, but you know, that’s been done with
VR, right? [laughter] And you’d be amazed how many 19-year-old boys are completely out of ideas
when you take those off the table.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the very end, Fisler addressed my questions about creativity and
discovery. She posed these questions of her own: &amp;#34;Do we overstate the
case for creativity?&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Is pure constructivism a win?&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve ranted on contructivism before. It can be great but a
constructivist lesson takes a knowledgeable educator and a lot of time,
preparation, and effort. It&amp;#39;s a big ask for, say, a high school
teacher who&amp;#39;s already taking home hours of work every evening. Too
often I&amp;#39;ve seen the following &amp;#34;contructivist&amp;#34; model instead:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take an isntructor that doesn&amp;#39;t know their craft, the content, or
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
niether.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let the kids play with stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Show off the couple of autodidacts that figure it out as success
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
stories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll rant more about this &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; with respect to the new buzz word
&amp;#34;lead learner&amp;#34; at some point in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the creativity side, it&amp;#39;s important but there are also times for
the instructor to lead and for guidelines to be followed.
We want to foster creativity but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s 100%
creativity 100% of the time. Education is like life, a balance. The
Bootstrap program had to constrain the CS and math learning but
allowed for creativity in other areas. It&amp;#39;s smart and it&amp;#39;s a win.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still want to meet Shriram in person one day and now also Kathi
Fisler. I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect walking in but I left the talk
reminded of why I&amp;#39;m such a fan of Emmanuel, his team, and their work.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tools can shape how we think</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-2017-4-6/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/advent-2017-4-6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been having fun with this years &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventofcode.com&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; competition. So
far, I&amp;#39;ve been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I&amp;#39;ll be traveling for the weekend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/&#34;&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there&amp;#39;s a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it&amp;#39;s computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That&amp;#39;s true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8cZgEogWNw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; gesture=&#34;media&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Thoughts On A Hackathon</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/thoughts-on-a-hackathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/thoughts-on-a-hackathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday I was one of the judges at &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuyhacks.com/&#34;&gt;StuyHacks&lt;/a&gt;. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don&amp;#39;t have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Java
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C#
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Scratch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A-Frame
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Python / Flask
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
HTML/CSS/JS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and more
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I&amp;#39;m getting old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I&amp;#39;d love to help with future events.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I&amp;#39;ve
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn&amp;#39;t seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn&amp;#39;t a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we&amp;#39;re too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that&amp;#39;ll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: &amp;#34;You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata&amp;#34; or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They&amp;#39;re prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A hackathon isn&amp;#39;t a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn&amp;#39;t
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn&amp;#39;t
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I&amp;#39;m
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It&amp;#39;s just something I noticed. It&amp;#39;s a problem for schools and
also for a society that&amp;#39;s test obsessed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you&amp;#39;re a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks &lt;a href=&#34;http://stuyhacks.com/&#34;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to attend their next event.

      <title>Early Interesting Problems - Happy Ladybugs</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/happy_ladybug/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/happy_ladybug/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We all love interesting problems. The trouble is that it&amp;#39;s hard to
find suitably interesting problems for students when they&amp;#39;re just
learning the basics. In the very beginning the problems practically
dictate the solution:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
loop over a list and add all the elements or calculate the sum of a
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
list of integers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Determine if  number is prime
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Convert a word into pig-Latin
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not that there&amp;#39;s no thought involved in solving these but the
students already know the mechanics of solving these by hand so it&amp;#39;s a
direct translation into a program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing and it is important but it&amp;#39;s fun when we get to the next
level. I&amp;#39;ve found that a number of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackerrank.com&#34;&gt;Hacker Rank&lt;/a&gt; archived
competitions have &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; problems that can be a good fit for
beginners. One that I found and really like is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/happy-ladybugs&#34;&gt;Happy Ladybugs&lt;/a&gt; problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The problems is basically as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You get a string of letters. Each letter represents a ladybug of a
different color. Each letter also represents a location of the
ladybug.  A space (or underscore in the actual problem) represents a
free space. For example &amp;#34;AABC DDA&amp;#34; is a line of 2 A colored ladybugs
followed by a B colored one, C colored one, a blank space, 2 D colored and then one
more A colored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can rearrange the line of ladybugs by swapping any ladybug with a
blank space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A ladybug is happy if it is next to another ladybug of the same
color. The challenge is to determine if all the ladybugs can be made
happy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like this problem because while it is non-trivial it is very
approachable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me, the key is that while you can rearrange the list you
don&amp;#39;t have to. You only have to determine if it is possible to make
the ladybugs happy. You don&amp;#39;t actually have to do so.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The edge cases are pretty easy to deal with - a string of length one
or two but then a little thought is required.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first insight is that if there are no spaces, you can&amp;#39;t rearrange
the ladybugs so all you have to do is scan through the string to test
to see if every ladybug has a neighbor of the same color.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next insight, and the big one is that if you have at least one
space you can arbitrarily re-order the string. You can show this is
possible  by using a single space to swap any two elements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final insight is that since you can arbitrarily re-order the
ladybugs as long as you have at least 2 of each color, you can make
them all happy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since my class is currently just starting dictionaries in Python we
solved this with lists and then transitioned to dictionaries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s a dictionary based solution:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I love problems like these.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just wish there was an easy way to find all contest problems of a
certain level like &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34; If anybody knows please share
in the comments.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Idioms</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/programming-idioms/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/programming-idioms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I just read Jeff Yearout&amp;#39;s recent post titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://k12csteaching.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-beginners-garden-of-concepts.html&#34;&gt;The Beginner&amp;#39;s Garden of
Concepts&lt;/a&gt;. Not directly related but it got me thinking about
programming idioms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been using the phrase &amp;#34;programming idiom&amp;#34; for years to describe a
short useful recurring code construct. I didn&amp;#39;t realize that it was
officially &amp;#34;a thing&amp;#34; until doing a web search on the phrase years
later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As our students grow from newbies on I think it&amp;#39;s helpful for them to
see recurring and related patterns and programming idioms gives us a
name to apply to many beginner patterns. An early idiom might be
&amp;#34;finding the smallest in a list:&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another is the very similar and more general &amp;#34;do something on every
item in a list:&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By talking about constructs like these as idioms it helps students see
and develop coding patterns. It also helps them to build mental
abstractions. Each of the above idioms are a few lines of code but
each are also a single concept. Students learn to think of them as the
concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When students learn about list comprehensions in python they&amp;#39;ll
rewrite the &amp;#34;do something…&amp;#34; more like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
but the pattern or idea is the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other early idioms might include swapping variables:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and loops until an exit condition are met:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even more difficult concepts like recursion can be described in an
idiomatic way:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-python&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Patterns like these, or idioms, come up over and over again. We don&amp;#39;t
have to explicitly mention them in our teaching but I think it&amp;#39;s
helpful to our students if we do.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Term New Tool - Thonny, a Python IDE</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/new-tool-thonny/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/new-tool-thonny/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last year I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/new-term-new-tool-replit&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://repl.it&#34;&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt;, an online IDE that supports multiple
languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and
since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I
used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a
lab where I couldn&amp;#39;t easily install my own software. I&amp;#39;ll continue to
use repl.it - mostly for it&amp;#39;s ability to schedule publish and manage
assignments but when possible, I like having my students work
locally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year I&amp;#39;m excited about another tool - &lt;a href=&#34;http://thonny.org&#34;&gt;Thonny&lt;/a&gt;. Thonny&amp;#39;s a simple
Python IDE designed for beginners. I discovered it last year but at a
time when it was impractical for me to use with my students. This
year I can and I&amp;#39;m really liking it. I&amp;#39;m still an Emacs guy and will
continue to use Emacs for my python development (&lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-12-python/&#34;&gt;video 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-13-yasnippet&#34;&gt;video 2&lt;/a&gt;) but
for beginners I think Thonny is the way to go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of Thonny&amp;#39;s highlights:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An integrated Python 3 virtual environment making for ease of
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
installation and consistency across student installs
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A debugger that shows how expressions are evaluated
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Great visualizations of function calls that make it easier to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
understand the call stack and scope
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ability to look at memory to understand references.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than go into the gory details in text, I put together this
video:
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWaCl0WjNZI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Theseus&#39;s Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/theseuss-curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/theseuss-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing
about my class rules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead I think I&amp;#39;ll riff on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo&#34;&gt;Alfred Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s post today titled
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/09/curriculum-is-hard.html&#34;&gt;Curriculum is Hard&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and
development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&amp;#39;s
something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a
curriculum your own?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the
whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&amp;#39;s clearly not your
curriculum. It probably also isn&amp;#39;t really teaching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about the more common case. Math curricula has basically been set
for years. Algebra, Geometry [fn::which is really logic and deductive
reasoning using Euclidean Geometry as platform], and then Algebra 2
and Trigonometry. Most books seem to be sequenced in a similar way
and at least in the schools I know about, the math department has some
document listing a day by day list of topics. This makes sense since
you probably have more than one class of each type and you want some
cross class consistency. Particularly during the first weeks of the
semester when kids can transfer and then also at the end of term or
year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a teacher uses that departmental document are they using someone
elses curriculum?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if they create their own homeworks and assigments?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most teachers I know use the department&amp;#39;s curriculum but make their
own unit and day to day lesson plans. Most revise them each
semester. Typically these teachers do a little more here or a little
less there depending on a number of factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Are they creating their own curriculum?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What if they re-sequence the topics?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about adding an enrichment topic?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back when I taught math I used the departmental syllabus, as many
texts as I could find, colleagues lesson plans and whatever I could
find but I always pulled it together to something I could call my
own. If I didn&amp;#39;t, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been comfortable going in front of
my class. Was it my curriculum? They were certainly my lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, when designing a course I start from the end outcomes and work
backwards but when teaching a course, I still look at as many
resources as I can find. I&amp;#39;ll pull a little from here, a little from
there and combine that with whatever I can come up with myself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, when is it your curriculum and when is it not?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re just delivering scripted lessons it&amp;#39;s certainly not yours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you know your stuff and you  take someone elses material, make it
your own and add it to your bag of tricks, I think it&amp;#39;s now yours as
well.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching APCS-A for the first time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teaching-ap-first-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/teaching-ap-first-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I got  an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he
mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this
year. He&amp;#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&amp;#39;t
really done much using Java.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here
instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn
your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&amp;#39;s OK to tell
your kids &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;ll get back to you.&amp;#34;. Don&amp;#39;t worry, you&amp;#39;ll be great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first time I taught APCS was some time around 1991 or 1992. It was at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sewardparkhs.com/Famous-Alumni/&#34;&gt;Seward Park&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sewardparkhs.com/History/&#34;&gt;High School&lt;/a&gt;. It was the AB curriculum - that is one
semester of programming in Pascal and one semester of Data Structures
and Algorithms.  Being a computer science major the core material was
never a concern. I had taken APCS the first time it was offered in May
1984 in Pascal and while most of my college and pre-teaching professional work
was in C, my college started it&amp;#39;s CS sequence with Pascal. I was more
concerned with the actual teaching part. I had taught math for a year
and a half at that point but never CS and by any measure I was still
wet behind the ears. I never finished that first experience because I
was excessed to Stuy mid semester. I wasn&amp;#39;t particularly happy with my
performance but looking back, I think I did a pretty good job given
the situation and my experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After teaching math for a year and a half I was back in APCS at
Stuy. Still in Pascal. I spent the next few years figuring out how to
teach CS and APCS in particular along with starting a couple of new
classes. When the College Board decided to move the AP class to C++ I
was happy, sad and a little worried. Pascal had a bunch of limitations
but I had never used C++. True, I was a C programmer at heart but I
had never really done the OOP thing. I did, as it turned out, design a
number of my C systems in an Object Typed design: I would use a single
file per &amp;#34;class&amp;#34; where local variables were de facto instance
variables and functions in the file were methods and each file was a
singleton class. I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design-Applications-3rd/dp/020189551X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1503519770&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Grady+Booch&#34;&gt;Booch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8&#34;&gt;Meyer&lt;/a&gt; on my own but I had no
schooling in OOP and no professional experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it turned out, I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry. I knew my CS and while it
took me a while to become comfortable with OOP, the class, and of
course I knew this from the get go, started from nothing and built
up complexity a step at a time. The worst that might have happened is
that some of my solutions might have been more C-esque than C++.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The move to Java was a little more jarring. Now we had a totally new
language. I couldn&amp;#39;t fall back on C. It removed memory management and
explicit pointers and it had to be used in an Object Oriented
manner. I remember asking Mike Schidlowsky, a former student turned
friend who was the Java consultant on the Java edition of Sedgewick&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Sedgewick-Algorithms-Fundamentals-Structures/dp/B008VR3ZH4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1503520269&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=schidlowsky&#34;&gt;Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; book how to do something. It had to do with passing and
modifying arrays. In C there were a number of ways to accomplish what
I wanted to do. In Java, I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to do it the way I
wanted. My friend Mike told me &amp;#34;you just don&amp;#39;t do it that way in
Java.&amp;#34; Again, it turned out that I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry. The basic
coding was still the same as were the data structures and
algorithms. The only challenge was that I had to get into a Java OOP
mindset which it turned out wasn&amp;#39;t that hard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I never really warmed up to OOP - I find other paradigms more
natural for me, I knew my CS and got more and more comfortable with
the Java (or C++) way of doing things as time wore on. Sometimes I
would say &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;let&amp;#39;s figure it out&amp;#34; but that&amp;#39;s OK.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nowadays, there are many more resources available for CS teachers. If
you&amp;#39;re new, lean on them. Use the mailing lists, stackexchange,
facebook groups. Online resources like repl.it, codehs.com etc. Yes,
it&amp;#39;s true that you&amp;#39;ll be better next time around and even better years
down the road but right now, you&amp;#39;re probably better than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A number of my former students volunteer for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tealsk12.org/&#34;&gt;TEALS&lt;/a&gt; - a really great
program that brings software engineers into the classroom to work with
non-CS teachers to deliver instruction. A number of my kids have
shared the following sentiment:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m really helping
the teacher to become self sufficient or if I&amp;#39;m a great teacher but I
do know one thing - while I&amp;#39;m there, the kids are getting a hell of a
lot more than if I wasn&amp;#39;t there.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
– Remember that as well.
