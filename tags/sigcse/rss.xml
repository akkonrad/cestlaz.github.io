      <description>&amp;lt;figure class=&amp;#34;z_image_center&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;  The Nifty Assignments session at SGICSE is always a popular one.  Go to the site and you&amp;#39;ll find links to all the assignments presented from 1999 to the present year.  On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s a great resource. On the other, the assignments vary in nifty-ness depending on one&amp;#39;s personal taste. To me, there seemed to be a run of nifty assignments that were really just &amp;#34;take a generic assignment and fancy up the graphics&amp;#34; mixed in with one&amp;#39;s that I found really cool.</description>

      <title>SIGCSE 2019 - the keynotes</title>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s that time of the year to write a series of blog posts about SIGCSE. I thought I&amp;#39;d start with one on the keynotes.  There were four keynote speakers. Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend, Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&amp;#39;t at the first timer&amp;#39;s lunch where Townsend spoke so I won&amp;#39;t talk at all about that keynote.  I&amp;#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific summary of his SIGCSE experience and did a much better job giving overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&amp;#39;ll just refer you to Andy&amp;#39;s blog post.</description>
