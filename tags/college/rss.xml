      <description>Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for Hunter&#39;s incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we&#39;ve come in under three years.
Hunter&#39;s had a strong but little known undergraduate CS program for as long as I&#39;ve known. Much like any program, we&#39;ve got our strengths and weaknesses but you go through our program and academically you&#39;ll be as well prepared as from anywhere else.</description>
