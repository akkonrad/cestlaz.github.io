      <description>note - elite universities are not fair comparions - kids at stanford etc are already pre-selected to succceed
won&#39;t have many career changers
don&#39;t want to discard current kids
politicians need to win the news cycle
many of the &#34;thought leaders&#34; don&#39;t know any better
pre service will take time
sooner start sooner get there
can&#39;t do good enough</description>

      <title>Do you teach CS or do you teach children?</title>

      <description>At the time, I thought it was a bogus question. First day of a graduate class for aspiring school supervisors, the professor asks &#34;What do you teach?&#34; We all answered. &#34;Math,&#34; &#34;History,&#34; &#34;English,&#34; etc.. At the end, the professor pointed out that &#34;none of you said that you taught children.&#34;
I thought it was bogus because we were a room full of teachers. We all taught students. What differentiated us was subject matter and grade level.</description>
