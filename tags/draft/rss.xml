      <description>At the time, I thought it was a bogus question. First day of a graduate class for aspiring school supervisors, the professor asks &#34;What do you teach?&#34; We all answered. &#34;Math,&#34; &#34;History,&#34; &#34;English,&#34; etc.. At the end, the professor pointed out that &#34;none of you said that you taught children.&#34;
I thought it was bogus because we were a room full of teachers. We all taught students. What differentiated us was subject matter and grade level.</description>
