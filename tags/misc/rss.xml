      <description>Teachers and Police   It&amp;#39;s been an ugly few days but perhaps in some ways a hopeful few as people have been making their voices heard like never before in my lifetime. We&amp;#39;ve seen and endless stream of videos of peaceful protest and far too many instances of police officers overstepping their bounds. I keep hearing about violent protesters but those videos seem to be avoiding my feeds as are the videos of law enforcement going after the looters who are a separate group from the protestors.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve got some CS Ed stuff I want to write but can&amp;#39;t bring myself to writing about it today. I rarely post outside of my wheelhouse - CS, Education and the intersection of the two.  I don&amp;#39;t really think I&amp;#39;m qualified to say much about the current crisis. The out of control police, racism, class warfare, a failed government not only at the federal level but also in New York city and state but maybe I can share something worthwhile from my narrow experiences.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t been posting much over the past couple of weeks and that&amp;#39;s partly because we&amp;#39;ve been under the weather.  Yep - Covid-19.  First things first - we&amp;#39;re all either recovered or well on the way.  I thought I&amp;#39;d write up our experience as it might be useful for others who are going through similar. This disease is weird and seems to affect people differently but three of us followed a similar path.</description>

      <title>Email or USPS</title>

      <description>USPS is in financial trouble. That&amp;#39;s been pretty well documented recently. Most reasonable people will recognize that the USPS is both an important service and while it receives no taxpayer support would be profitable were it not for the GOP imposing unfair and unrealistic pension funding requirements in 2006.  Although I&amp;#39;m an ardent supporter of the post office and feel that privatization of such an important intuition would be criminal today I want to talk about some small repercussions of so many things going to email rather than snail mail.</description>

      <description> Yesterday was the start of Passover and like many others we weren&amp;#39;t able to physically gather with friends and family to celebrate. Since the Talmud, unlike the NYC Dept of Education, doesn&amp;#39;t seem to ban Zoom, like many others, we used Zoom to connect with family.  Tonight we&amp;#39;ll do it again.  In the meantime, I thought I&amp;#39;d share this small bit of research Natan did a couple of years ago on a traditional part of the seder: A Historically Informed Echad Mi Yodea  Enjoy </description>

      <description>Preamble   I&amp;#39;ve never accepted a guest post before but when my friend and long time colleague JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver said he had something to say I was all for it.  JonAlf&amp;#39;s one of the best teachers I know - he started at Brandeis HS and has been at Stuy forever. Really sharp guy, great teacher, and really perceptive. When he has something to say it&amp;#39;s 100% worth listening to.</description>

Besides, this isn&amp;#39;t the first recipe I&amp;#39;ve posted.  I&amp;#39;m one of those that will, as long as supplies allow, bake and cook my way through our shelter in. Today I made Brazilian carrot cake. It&amp;#39;s not quite the same as an American carrot cake as you&amp;#39;ll see from the recipe below.  First, carrot cake rules:  Obviously since it contains carrot which is a vegetable, it&amp;#39;s healthy.</description>

      <description>I was talking to a friend yesterday who had just started doing grad work in school leadership. It got me thinking about my original career plans and how you never know where you&amp;#39;re going to end up.  Well, not my original original career plans. When I started on Wall Street I had no idea what the future would bring. For all I knew, I could have been a career professional programmer or even gone over to the business side.</description>

      <description>Happy new year to everyone.  I&amp;#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&amp;#39;ve never been much for predictions so I thought I&amp;#39;d share some more local and personal things I&amp;#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.  First a couple of big ones.  I&amp;#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does fly.</description>

      <description>No, this post is not about the Waterfall development model. Devorah and I had a chance to take a little vacation up north.  First stop, Niagara Falls.      &amp;lt;br clear=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;&amp;gt;  We did the Canada side 9 years ago when we did our Erie Canal bike trip (you can read about that by checking out some of my early blog posts). This time, the American side.</description>

      <description>I spent today at Codeland, a one day conference in NYC designed for developers in the early stages of their careers. Just as at CSTA, I was there with the GitHub contingent.  Codeland had talks and a keynote in a common auditorium, smaller breakout workshops and a couple of small vendor areas.  I spent most of the morning upstairs in the GitHub lounge so I onl caught part of one morning talk.</description>

      <description>There were a bunch of threads on the 10X Developer recently. You know - that mythical beast that&amp;#39;s 10 times more productive than the regular software engineer. I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the original threads but I&amp;#39;m guessing they started with &amp;#34;your startup needs them&amp;#34; and then moved to the &amp;#34;they can&amp;#39;t work with anyone&amp;#34; along with tons of fun tongue and cheek 1X engineer tweets.  It got me thinking about 10X students.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m a big fan of E Ink e-readers. I had one a number of years ago. An Aztak EZ Reader. It was great. Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for technical books but for easy reading there was nothing like having tons of reading options always available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s Saturday morning. It&amp;#39;s been a busy week. It looks like there&amp;#39;s a couple more to plough through but hopefully then I can catch my breath over spring break.  Why so busy? It&amp;#39;s the same old story - you&amp;#39;ve got all those projects that you&amp;#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.  To start off, it&amp;#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors all know their options and are deciding where to go.</description>

My old one was a 27&amp;#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&amp;#34; Hanns G to bring in but they were no longer available.</description>

      <description>One of the side benefits of visiting high schools is that I end up going all over the city. This takes me to neighborhoods that I normally wouldn&amp;#39;t have reason to visit. For a New York History wonk that can be pretty cool even if you just limit yourself to looking at the schools. A few of the schools I visited in the last couple of weeks before the new year were self contained whole building schools:    James Madison    Goddard High School    FDR HS    Midwood HS    Goddard was interesting because it was founded in 2008 and grew out of the middle school in the same building.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and so don&amp;#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher knows, the year really goes from September through June with that really long much needed weekend that you regular folks call July and August tacked on to separate years.  This whole January first thing is really more of a half time break or perhaps an intermission.</description>

      <description>Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to Catskills Conf, an annual event that I describe as &amp;#34;light tech conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve written about the event before if anyone&amp;#39;s interested in more details. As in past years, Devorah ran her knitting for good project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made blankets to children in crisis.</description>

      <description>Once again, it&amp;#39;s time for Advent of Code - a series of small programming problems released once a day.  I wrote a bit about it last year and you can still find last years problems here.  It&amp;#39;s only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I&amp;#39;m thinking of looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.</description>

Yesterday evening, she was at work late for &amp;#34;curriculum night.&amp;#34; Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of presentations. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two former public school kids in college, and that&amp;#39;s about it for the personal info.</description>

My father, who always wanted to be an opera singer sang with &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Opera_of_Manhattan&amp;#34;&amp;gt;LOOM&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; back in the day and there was always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father singing. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Recently, there&amp;#39;s been a kerfufle over what was to be &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://nygasp.org&amp;#34;&amp;gt;NYGASP&amp;#39;s&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; production of Mikado. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.</description>

Yes, we were the city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores, sole proprieterships. You could become a &amp;#34;regular.</description>

      <description>Spent the past few days at the Tapia Conference in Seattle.
The Tapia conference is billed as a &amp;ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in Computing.&amp;rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from industry.
What was I doing there?</description>

      <description>This past Monday I, like may woke to hear about the passing of Pete Seeger. Ten days earlier we were up at Symphony Space for the &amp;ldquo;Woody&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rdquo; 45th Anniversary Concert. Pete was supposed to perform but was ill. At 94 years of age, I wondered if the end was near. I was at the concert with my family as well as with my buddy Ben. Fitting since Ben and I grew up on Pete&amp;rsquo;s music while many of our peers did not.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one for New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions.
If I&amp;rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it, but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at it.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re practically at the close of 2013 and it&amp;rsquo;s high time I wished everyone wonderful things for the year to come.
It&amp;rsquo;s also time for a new look to this blog.
Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that toolset and was just figuring things out.
I&amp;rsquo;m still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.</description>

      <description>So, the Citibike program has been running for a bit. I like the idea, but I have some reservations &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s great for getting around in the zone - I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for short shopping trips - run cross town to Fairway or take a quick trip from work to Porto Rico Importers or Rocco&amp;rsquo;s Pastries. On the other hand, the zone doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to the residential neighborhoods of upper Manhattan or the boroughs and the price per day is way too expensive for regular working class joes, particularly on top of a subway trip.</description>
