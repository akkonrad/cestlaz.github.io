      <description>At this point, we&#39;ve done a fair amount of playing with text so it&#39;s time for a fun little project. We&#39;re going to generate some text &#34;in the style&#34; of a source text. The technique we&#39;re going to use is usually called a Markov Chain text generator. Basically a model where the next state or word is based entirely on the current state. I don&#39;t dwell on the math under the hood but in case you&#39;re interested, here are a few links: Wikipedia, Explained Visually, UC Davis Math.</description>

      <description>Following up on a previous post, we&#39;re going to continue to talk about playing with text. This time, building and working with a bag of words from a text.
A bag of words is a simple language processing model where you just consider individual words in a text. What they are and how many times they occur. This is a pretty simple model but you can still have a good bit of fun with your students with it.</description>
