      <description>Following up on a previous post, we&#39;re going to continue to talk about playing with text. This time, building and working with a bag of words from a text.
A bag of words is a simple language processing model where you just consider individual words in a text. What they are and how many times they occur. This is a pretty simple model but you can still have a good bit of fun with your students with it.</description>
