      <description>I&#39;m enjoying reading about Ria Galanos&#39; new chapter on her blog. In her most recent post Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.</description>

      <description>Two of the hardest topics to make meaningful to students in APCS-A are inheritance and interfaces. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re super difficult topics but rather that they&#39;re not often needed, useful, or superior to not using them on beginner assignments. More often than not the motivation is a bit forced as are the assignments.
Inheritance is its own can of worms and to be honest, something I&#39;ve not found to be all that useful or necessary.</description>
