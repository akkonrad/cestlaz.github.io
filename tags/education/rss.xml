      <description>As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&amp;#39;re planning to get started this summer. I&amp;#39;ve received many questions about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later but one question I frequently get is &amp;#34;will it be offered online?&amp;#34; This is also something I&amp;#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.</description>

      <title>Teacher Centric Teaching</title>

      <description>Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new teaching fad research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits all. If we do, we&amp;#39;re good teachers, if we don&amp;#39;t we get the dreaded ineffective on our annual ratings.  I was reminded of this when reading Mark Guzdial&amp;#39;s recent blog post on things he got wrong in Computing Education.</description>

      <description>No,I&amp;#39;m not talking aboutArgument from Authority - something that very much plagues CS Education and education in general where an annointed few who may, or may not really know what they&amp;#39;re talking about are given creedence because they&amp;#39;ve been there the longest, work for the companies with the biggest names, have the economic backing or otherwise have been given the stage.  I&amp;#39;m talking about Proof by Authority which I fondly remember from those silly Proof techniques lists that went around in the day.</description>

      <description>Just saw this:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;amp;#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS).

      <title>The Hunter Daedalus Fall 2019 recruiting class</title>

      <description>Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&amp;#39;d share some information on Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.  I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&amp;#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&amp;#39;t exist.</description>

      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2019-keynotes/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s that time of the year to write a series of blog posts about SIGCSE. I thought I&amp;#39;d start with one on the keynotes.  There were four keynote speakers. Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend, Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&amp;#39;t at the first timer&amp;#39;s lunch where Townsend spoke so I won&amp;#39;t talk at all about that keynote.  I&amp;#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific summary of his SIGCSE experience and did a much better job giving overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&amp;#39;ll just refer you to Andy&amp;#39;s blog post.</description>

      <title>Thoughts On Code And Beyond - Computational Thinking</title>

      <description>The theme of this year&amp;#39;s To Code and Beyond was Computational Thinking. Mark Guzdial gave the keynote. While the talk isn&amp;#39;t currently online, check out this talk that Mark gave last March. It&amp;#39;s not the same but the second halves are and well worth a look.  In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &amp;#34;thinking.&amp;#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&amp;#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.</description>

      <title>Is There a First Grade Machine Learning Achievement Gap?</title>

      <description>Today was the fifth &amp;#34;To Code and Beyond&amp;#34; - a one day conference hosted at Cornell Technion and once again Diane Levitt put together a great show. The theme was Computational Thinking and the day consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was being done with some of our most vulnerable students.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve never been much of a New Years person. I get up really early and so don&amp;#39;t usually stay up late and more to the point, as any teacher knows, the year really goes from September through June with that really long much needed weekend that you regular folks call July and August tacked on to separate years.  This whole January first thing is really more of a half time break or perhaps an intermission.</description>

      <description>I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their Great Hall, a place famous for Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s speech that some say propelled him to the presidency.  I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers with an ward for &amp;#34;Excellence in the Teaching of Science and Mathematics.&amp;#34;  I was their to see my friend Dave Deutsch, a long time public school physics teacher receive the honor.</description>

Am I allowed to put language in my syllabus that penalizes students for obnoxious, intentional misspellings?

      <description>I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in Times Square. What was I doing there? Aankit Patel invited me to check out the professional development that he and his team organized for the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his office runs.  Wow.  Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by TEALS, a room of BJC teachers, a group working with p5.</description>

      <title>When the students know more than the teacher</title>

      <description>We&amp;#39;ve heard it many times with computer science - &amp;#34;the kids know more than the teacher.&amp;#34;  On the one hand, the truth is that this isn&amp;#39;t so much the case. Kids might use computers all the time but they don&amp;#39;t necessarily know much about them or about computer science (link 1, link 2). Then you have students who think they know all about CS but really don&amp;#39;t. They might have picked up a bit of coding somewhere but more often than not, the knowledge is pretty superficial.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I&amp;#39;ve been a member of CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I&amp;#39;ve made it to the annual conference.  The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech conference.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I shared my thoughts on Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s plans to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the selection criteria for New York City&amp;#39;s specialized high schools. If you haven&amp;#39;t read the post, you can find it here.  I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but there&amp;#39;s more to the story.  In spite of what BdB stated, it&amp;#39;s not enough for him to switch to another measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Bill de Blasio, the current Mayor of New York City outlined how he would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; our specialized schools. The schools he was referring to were the &amp;#34;big three&amp;#34; of Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, and Brooklyn Tech and then five additional schools - The High School for Math Science and Engineering at CCNY, The High School for American Studies at Lehman, Brooklyn Latin, The Queens Arts and Science High School at York College, and Staten Island Tech.</description>

      <description>Alfred Thompson wrote about CS education tools earlier today. I&amp;#39;ve also been meaning to write on the topic but from a different point of view.  I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&amp;#39;s not really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work on I&amp;#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent technology.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write about ethics in CS education for a while. Probably since I saw this article in the NY Times but got sidetracked.  I was reminded when I saw this tweet by Hadi the other day:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34; data-lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;This message is bigger than Facebook. Computer science faces an ethics crisis. That’s why &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/codeorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;@codeorg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; covers ethics and digital citizenship in our computer science courses.</description>

      <description>The ACM recently announced this year&amp;#39;s winners of the Cutler-Bell Prize in High School Computing. Over on his blog, Alfred Thompson noted that the winners were either from independent or magnet public schools. Alfred also noted that most of the winners of prestigious science competitions like the Regeneron Science Talent Search (nee Intel, nee Westinghouse) were from public magnet schools. In his post, Alfred ruminates on this and wonders &amp;#34;how to we add the flexibility and support to more students at more schools?</description>

      <description>Next up from SIGCSE 2018 is John MacCormick&amp;#39;s session on Strategies for Baing the CS Theory Course on Non-decision Problems  MacCormicks&amp;#39;s stance is that CS theory is tough the first time around and using non-decision problems is a viable approach to make theory more accessible to beginners. As MacCormick said in his paper:   … a decision problem may ask the yes/no question, &amp;#34;Does this graph have a Hamilton cycle?</description>

      <description>After reading a couple of comments on my last post where I talked a bit about practitioners vs researchers I thought I&amp;#39;d expand and expound a bit.  While there are education researchers that I very much respect, overall, I&amp;#39;m skeptical of education research. Note that I&amp;#39;m not talking specifically about CS Ed research but rather education research in general.  Let&amp;#39;s go back to the beginning. I entered teaching from industry.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) situation</title>

      <description>In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.  A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to actually settle in a position.  The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration.</description>

      <description>Today was Election Day. One of the few days each year when students stay home and teachers spend all day attending what is generously known as professional development.  Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave - one of the best math teachers I know said &amp;#34;you know, every time we have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn&amp;#39;t get annoyed since they&amp;#39;re spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;#39;ve learned from teaching is that there&amp;#39;s always something new to learn. For the kids, yes, but I&amp;#39;m talking about for the teacher.  The other day, I taught a lesson I&amp;#39;ve taught many times. Find the mode of a data set. That&amp;#39;s the problem that they solve but the lesson is really about run time complexity, hidden complexity and using data structures in alternate ways.  I blogged about this before so you can get an earlier take there although the code isn&amp;#39;t formatted correctly due to blog conversions.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was Catskillsconf - my favorite event of the year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great weekend but I was mostly offline.  As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).</description>

      <description>People sometimes accuse me of being an elitist CS snob that I feel that CS teachers have to have advanced CS degrees.  It&amp;#39;s not that at all. Rather, I feel that CS teachers are smart and capable. Circumstances frequently result in a teacher in front of a CS class with limited content and pedagogical content knowledge. It&amp;#39;s not ideal but it&amp;#39;s reality. Of course I feel that we should do everything to support and encourage these teachers but we should also insist that after a reasonable period of time, they know their stuff.</description>

TL;DR (although it really isn&amp;#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&amp;#39;s on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34; education and why she&amp;#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.  Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve education.</description>

      <description>I got an email from a friend the other day. Among other things, he mentioned that he would be teaching APCS-A for the first time this year. He&amp;#39;s a little trepidatious. He knows his stuff but he hasn&amp;#39;t really done much using Java.  I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.   TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&amp;#39;s OK to tell your kids &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;ll get back to you.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;#39;m back from vacation and summer&amp;#39;s winding down I thought I&amp;#39;d start getting back to more classroom related posts. I still have a few summer topics I want to write about – standards and side projects in particular but I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the classroom since, after all, at my core, I&amp;#39;m a teacher. When I saw this article in my inbox this morning I thought I&amp;#39;d talk about it.</description>

      <description>This morning, I read Alfred Thompson&amp;#39;s post on teaching cybersecurity. as Alfred says, it&amp;#39;s something of a CS Ed buzzword this summer.  Another hot topic in K12 CS Ed this summer is the inclusion of ethics in our CS courses courtesy of efforts like the #ethicalCS twitter chat every Wednesday at 8:00 Eastern time hosted by Saber Khan.  Discussions about both topics include &amp;#34;where should we be doing this?</description>

      <description>Back in May, I read this post about Angela Duckworth and Grit. Grit has become an education buzzword in the past few years so I figured I should read Duckworth&amp;#39;s book. It took this long because there was a long waiting list at the New York Public Library to get the ebook. I&amp;#39;m still not quite finished with the book but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some of my thoughts on the book and the buzz.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Mark Guzdial blogged about a NY Times piece discussing Silicon Valleys influence on education through Code.org.  Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&amp;#39;t read Mark&amp;#39;s blog and you&amp;#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.  I tried to leave a comment on Mark&amp;#39;s blog - not about the NY Times article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&amp;#39;s important that we remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and impact on CS education and on education in general.</description>

      <description>Brenda Wilkerson, Director of CS and IT education for Chicago public schools was one of the keynote speakers at this year&amp;#39;s CSTA conference. During her talk, she made a comment about it taking three times through to get it right so if you&amp;#39;re working hard and struggling in your first year of teaching CS, it&amp;#39;s not the time to give up. Learning to teach takes time.  She&amp;#39;s absolutely correct.</description>

      <description>For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago I couldn&amp;#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&amp;#39;s darling. It&amp;#39;s really amazing. It&amp;#39;s been a combination of grass roots efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as TEALS, advocacy of groups like Code.org and amazing individuals like Fred Wilson who has probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10 people combined.</description>

      <description>AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&amp;#39;t, some don&amp;#39;t really care.  I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:  Don&amp;#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.  I never really cared much about my students&amp;#39; actual AP scores.</description>

      <description>Back in February, I shared my thoughts on losing CS teachers to the tech industy. TL;DR - I don&amp;#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.  That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good teachers in general.  There are plenty of reasons why it&amp;#39;s harder to become a career teacher but I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about those today.</description>

      <description>The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system didn&amp;#39;t work.</description>

For those of you not in the CS Education space, SIGCSE is the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) special interest group for computer science education.  I&amp;#39;ve wanted to go for years but have never been able. It&amp;#39;s hard for a high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in places with a school calendar similar to New York.</description>

      <description>If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&amp;#39;t they just jump ship and take tech industry jobs?   I hear that a lot.  Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.  Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge, even less real content knowledge. That will keep them in the classroom.</description>

      <description>Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy&amp;#39;s intro CS course. Like any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a first language and why despite that, I don&amp;#39;t recommend it in many cases.  Scheme certainly isn&amp;#39;t mainstream. That&amp;#39;s not the main reason why I like it but it is a side benefit.</description>

      <description>I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly in the form of &amp;#34;why don&amp;#39;t you start them with Javascript?&amp;#34;  Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme, NetLogo and then later Python, I&amp;#39;d get similar pushback but then it was &amp;#34;why not Java?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m guessing my views on this aren&amp;#39;t very popular -that&amp;#39;s OK, every community needs a curmudgeon.  A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&amp;#39;t careful, once the big players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&amp;#39;re well on our way down that road.  I&amp;#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer programs.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#39;t know Hunter College had computer science.   I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS&amp;#39;s low profile and small size in spite of its high quality.  Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer Science programs. I&amp;#39;d hear things like &amp;#34;but they only offer a BA not a BS,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;but Hunter isn&amp;#39;t an engineering school.</description>

Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote positions you disagree with.</description>

      <description>This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the past few weeks http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/. It&amp;#39;s from 2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.</description>

For those of you who aren&amp;#39;t familiar, that&amp;#39;s the latest incarnation of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search from back in my day.  It seems that Stuyvesant hasn&amp;#39;t had that many semi finalists, finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn&amp;#39;t happy about it.</description>

      <description>If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to avc.com, Today, Fred&amp;#39;s post talked about development and progress, evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related, it got me thinking about gentrification.  To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out people and business that were there during the hard times.  We don&amp;#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater economic opportunity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m way behind on my Communications of the ACM. I generally only read them when I use my trainer in the mornings and with summer running and outside riding, I&amp;#39;m still on the December 2015 issue.  This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on a program in Scotland. If you&amp;#39;re an ACM member, and if you&amp;#39;re a CS practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to comment on these tweets for a while:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34; data-lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;I went to high school with some scary smart people.

      <title>Federal Aid for Code Schools - is this a good thing?</title>

      <description>I saw this headline earlier today: The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech.  The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools will be able to accept federal student aid. I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;re talking student loans or grants but I&amp;#39;m not sure it matters.  The headline sounds great. I&amp;#39;m not so sure that this is a good thing.</description>

      <title>Ed Disruption - why it&#39;s different</title>

      <description>Earlier today I read this post by Eliot Horowitz, founder and CTO of MongoDB.  Eliot titled the post &amp;#34;Innovate vs Appropriate&amp;#34; and talks about the importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it&amp;#39;s well worth a read but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to &amp;#34;disrupt&amp;#34; education.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I read over Hillary&amp;#39;s briefing on her initiative on Technology and Innovation.  A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have my doubts. My feeling is that she&amp;#39;s pretty much aligned with the current administration education wise and the current administration has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public education.  While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much like some of the others, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that today.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I saw the New York Premiere of Navajo Math Circles, a documentary on a Math Circle put in place to support and enrich the currently under-served community in the Navajo educational system.  At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment programs. I&amp;#39;m most familiar with the New York Math Circle. I&amp;#39;m friends with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in their summer program for a couple of years.</description>
