      <description>Today was Election Day. One of the few days each year when students stay home and teachers spend all day attending what is generously known as professional development.
Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave - one of the best math teachers I know said &#34;you know, every time we have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn&#39;t get annoyed since they&#39;re spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD.</description>

      <description>Saw this tweet the other day so I though I would try to plug the Awesome CS Education list I started on GitHub:
#csteachers...didn&amp;#39;t I see a list of CS teacher blogs here recently?
&amp;mdash; Pam Whitlock (@PamWhitlock1) September 21, 2017 
To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is Alfred Thompson&#39;s blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog in 2012.</description>
