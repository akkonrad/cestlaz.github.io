      <title>Interesting Problems</title>

      <description>I organize a monthly professional development session for CS teachers. It&amp;#39;s targeted at teachers who are beyond the beginner stage and don&amp;#39;t want yet another hello world blinky arduino scratch workshop. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, given the need for CS teachers we need plenty of beginner workshops but we also need to take teachers to the next level. I refer to my workshops as being for teachers of APCS-A, similar, or beyond.</description>

      <description>I run periodic professional development sessions here in New York with my partner in crime JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver. I call them PD for &amp;#34;APCS-A, similar or beyond&amp;#34; and they&amp;#39;re designed to fill a professional development gap. We try to run them once a month but it&amp;#39;s a little less frequent than that.  The NYCDOE has taken on the monster task of CS for all and since they&amp;#39;re trying to get to everyone they have to run a bazillion sessions but all at an introductory level.</description>

      <description>Last week I spent a couple of days as part of a team running professional development for a group of pre and in service elementary school teachers. Two days talking about computational thinking.  Wait a minute - elementary school teachers? I&amp;#39;m a high school guy pretending to be a college guy. My extensive experience with elementary school education is that I raised two kids and I don&amp;#39;t think I messed them up too much.</description>

      <description>Looking forward to flying out to Phoenix for CSTA-2019 Saturday morning. The conference doesn&amp;#39;t officially start until Sunday, Monday for me since I&amp;#39;m not doing any of the pre-conference workshops. We&amp;#39;ll have most of Saturday as long as we&amp;#39;re up to it, Sunday, and Monday morning. Actually, there is the GitHub reception on Sunday evening so that&amp;#39;s kind of official conference stuff.  As to the conference, I&amp;#39;m super looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>Lat day of the 2019 NCWIT Summmit. Got up crazy early, got back from my run and saw this when I checked Twitter:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;A1: CSTA, Twitter chats like this one, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;@guzdial&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/alfredtwo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;@alfredtwo&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#39;s blogs among others. In all cases because those places start from assuming I&amp;amp;#39;m a CS teacher, rather than starting from assuming I&amp;amp;#39;m a teacher who is better at teaching something else.</description>

      <description>I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in Times Square. What was I doing there? Aankit Patel invited me to check out the professional development that he and his team organized for the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his office runs.  Wow.  Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by TEALS, a room of BJC teachers, a group working with p5.</description>

      <description>Today was Election Day. One of the few days each year when students stay home and teachers spend all day attending what is generously known as professional development.  Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave - one of the best math teachers I know said &amp;#34;you know, every time we have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn&amp;#39;t get annoyed since they&amp;#39;re spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD.</description>

      <description>Saw this tweet the other day so I though I would try to plug the Awesome CS Education list I started on GitHub:  &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;twitter-tweet&amp;#34; data-lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&amp;#34;en&amp;#34; dir=&amp;#34;ltr&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/csteachers?src=hash&amp;#34;&amp;gt;#csteachers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;â€¦didn&amp;amp;#39;t I see a list of CS teacher blogs here recently?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; Pam Whitlock (@PamWhitlock1) &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://twitter.com/PamWhitlock1/status/910662628757864448&amp;#34;&amp;gt;September 21, 2017&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&amp;#34; charset=&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is Alfred Thompson&amp;#39;s blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog in 2012.</description>
