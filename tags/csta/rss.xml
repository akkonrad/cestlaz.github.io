      <description>In addition to everything I wrote about last time there were a couple of other big announcements at this year&#39;s CSTA conference. Both announcements deal with funding.
First, there is a new class of CSTA membership. The free tier remains but now for $50 you can join CSTA+. This new level of membership comes with a bunch of extras that are probably good for K12 teachers but I doubt I&#39;ll use any of them.</description>
