      <description>I saw a couple of posts the other day about the CS Ed Podcast.
Kristin Stephens-Martinez of Duke interviewed (or will interview) six CS educators on a variety of topics. There are four posted so far:
 David Malan Dan Garcia Amy Ko Mark Guzdial  Before I started I thought I&#39;d listen to a few and then share some thoughts but I found so much to unpack in the second episode where Dan talks about testing that I decided to share my thoughts on the first episode, then Dan&#39;s and then see if find anything to comment on in episodes three and beyond.</description>
