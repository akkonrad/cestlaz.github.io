      <description>&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you&amp;#39;re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?  â€“ Brian Kernighan &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;  Debugging is what the third episode of the CS Ed Podcast was all about. Kristin Stephens-Martinez of Duke University speaks with Amy Ko of the University of Washington.</description>

      <title>CS Ed Podcast 2 - Dan Garcia on test creation</title>

      <description>Episode 2 of the CS Ed podcast had Dan Garcia talk about exam creation.  This wasn&amp;#39;t a podcast about the value of exams - in class, high stakes or otherwise. In fact Dan says in the podcast it would be great to &amp;#34;get grades out of the equation. Grades are gonna be an impediment to learning.&amp;#34; But recognizes that we have not say in this most of the time (and I&amp;#39;ll add that though I agree grades can and do perform a function) so we should be creative in terms of assessment.</description>

      <title>Riffing on the CS Ed Podcast - Episode 1 - David Malan</title>

      <description>I saw a couple of posts the other day about the CS Ed Podcast.  Kristin Stephens-Martinez of Duke interviewed (or will interview) six CS educators on a variety of topics. There are four posted so far:    David Malan    Dan Garcia    Amy Ko    Mark Guzdial    Before I started I thought I&amp;#39;d listen to a few and then share some thoughts but I found so much to unpack in the second episode where Dan talks about testing that I decided to share my thoughts on the first episode, then Dan&amp;#39;s and then see if find anything to comment on in episodes three and beyond.</description>
