        div.center {text-align:center;}   Scale, scale, scale. Scripted lessons. Online resources, Moocs. No excuses schools. All of these are modern trends in education. None of these are about good education. It's really demoralizing reading article after article devaluing true master teachers and real education.  So, last night was a real pleasure.  I attended a talk, given by Alan Alda on communicating science. The talk was sponsored by The Academy for Teachers.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   Just had an interesting conversation with Chris, one of our CSTUY mentors. Chris is working with one of our more advanced groups of hackers - they'll be creating a web based app that with ultimately be deployed as mobile using PhoneGap.  The question he had was "Angular.js or Backbone.js."  Chris and I have had this conversation before. I was explaining at the time why I preferred to use Backbone.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   The other day codehs made an announcement about their new autograder. Fellow CS Teaching veteran Alfred Thompson had his say up on his blog where he talked about Mark Guzdial's comment on autograders leading to less creative assignments.  I very much agree that autograders, due to their rigidness lend themselves to less creative projects, but thought I'd write up a few of my own thoughts on autograders.

    <div class="content post-summary">
        div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it's a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard's famous CS50. Since that conversation, I've spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don't really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren't for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.

Jack and David were both members of winning high school teams last year and they were back as college winners this time around.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.  I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again and ramps them up to speed.  In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.

Afterwards a few of us were chatting and a friend observed that when she first started to talk to high school kids she was shocked that they really didn't know the local tech players - neither names nor companies.  A couple of years ago, another friend was helping me organize an event for high schoolers.

        div.center {text-align:center;}   I've said it many times:   Never use a tool you couldn't write yourself.   That is - make sure you understand what's going on under the hood.  In AP we've been playing with ArrayLists. The problem for today? Create an ArrayList with consecutive integers and then write a routine that will randomize the ArrayList.  For example, you might start with this ArrayList: 0,1,2,3,4,5   and end up with 3,5,1,4,2,0   First cut, the students grabbed a random element from the ArrayList, removed it, and added it to the end of a new list.
