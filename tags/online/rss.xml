      <description>Hunter&#39;s classes are still on hiatus while we figure out how we&#39;re going to deliver instruction remotely. I have it easier than most. First, my students all get laptops as being part of the Daedalus program. This doesn&#39;t mean they have great internet access or access at all but it does mean they have a device that can run everything we need them to run. I don&#39;t yet know if they all have adequate internet access but I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s either not an issue or one that we can easily figure out.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been seeing some tweets over the past couple of days about the wonders of online teaching. How it&#39;s at least as good or better than in person or how we should have been doing it all along.
Rubbish.
If you say that online is better than in person that says more about the (low) quality of your teaching than it does about the quality of online tech teaching resources.</description>
