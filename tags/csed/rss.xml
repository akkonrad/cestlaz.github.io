      <description>Earlier today I saw a facebook post asking for thoughts on teaching sorting. The question was specifically not about motivations like having the class act out sorts or sort cards but rather about the coding.
I&#39;ve been meaning to write about this since last summer when I attended Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk on the same subject.
Early in my career when teaching sorting I developed the n^2 sorts as standalone routines just as they&#39;re presented in most books but as I gained more experience as a teacher, I changed it up to build the sorts (at least some of them) from existing concepts.</description>

      <description>I just read this post by Bethany Crystal - Going off script.
Bethany writes that while she normally essentially scripts important presentations, this time she went more off the cuff.
It made me think about how I teach and a disturbing trend I&#39;ve seen in CS education and education in general.
I&#39;ve never strictly used a script for teaching. When I started I did use very detailed lesson plans. Back then I was teaching math.</description>

When doing the Spiderman query, chances are the desired answer will be at or near the top of the list of most frequently appearing names but so will &#34;</description>

      <description>Parts 1 and 3  Part 1 Part 3  Part 2 When we left off last time we used a search engine API to gather a whole bunch of documents with the term &#34;played Spiderman&#34; or &#34;who played Spiderman.&#34; Now we have to process these documents to answer the question. Fortunately, the documents are basically just big strings of text.
Since we&#39;re doing a &#34;who&#34; query we want to find all the names in all the documents.</description>

      <description>Parts 2 and 3  Part 2 Part 3  I wasn&#39;t going to teach this lesson today. I was planning on starting a multi day project starting with an exercise in specification writing and design.
Beforehand though, we had to talk about classes. One of my students asked if probability and/or statistics were really important for CS. I started to cite a few examples and then decided to segue into this.</description>

      <description>Never use global variables Never break out of a loop  These are two &#34;best practices&#34; that are frequently touted in early CS classes both at the high school and college level.
They came up a couple of times yesterday. Once in the Facebook APCS-A teachers group and once on Alfred Thompson&#39;s blog.
Alfred post was topically on global variables. Actually it was deeper than just global variables. It&#39;s also about how students progress - what they can figure out at various stages of progress and how what seems like a good idea early on the path to computer science doesn&#39;t seem so great later on.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve heard it many times with computer science - &#34;the kids know more than the teacher.&#34;
On the one hand, the truth is that this isn&#39;t so much the case. Kids might use computers all the time but they don&#39;t necessarily know much about them or about computer science (link 1, link 2). Then you have students who think they know all about CS but really don&#39;t. They might have picked up a bit of coding somewhere but more often than not, the knowledge is pretty superficial.</description>

The program and Hunter CS as a whole have made a lot of progress over the past two years and each year I roll out new special activities and events for my honors students.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s been a lot of buzz recently concernting Computational Thinking (CT) vs Computer Science (CS) vs Coding / Programming on the interwebs.
 Some of the questions and concerns that I&#39;ve seen recently include: What is CT?? Will rich schools get CS and poor only CT? Will rich schools get CS and poor on coding?  The first question is a big one and as a community we haven&#39;t answered it yet.</description>

      <description>If you check out Twitter, Facebook, Medium and other blog sites you might get the idea that you&#39;re the worst teacher in the world. The internet abounds with people sharing tweets and posts about wonderful lessons they&#39;ve just taught, witnessed or learned about in professional development. Sure, the teacher forums rife with requests for lesson ideas and resources but the shared material is always aces.
It makes sense, people in the community want to share things that worked for them or things they think will work.</description>

      <description>I wanted to chime in on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post last week on what to include in a HS CS class but was working on moving blogging platforms so didn&#39;t get a chance so I&#39;ll say a few words here.
If you&#39;ve been here before you probably know I&#39;m not a fan of the standards and I certainly am no fan of the College Board and the AP program so what&#39;s my take?</description>

      <description>If one looks at my twitter feed they&#39;ll notice that in addition to CS Ed, another issue I&#39;m passionate about is school reform or rather resistance to what is popularly known as and mislabeled as school reform. I&#39;m anti vouchers, charter schools, high stakes testing and more. One of the heroes of this resistance is education historian Diane Ravitch. I&#39;m a big fan of Diane&#39;s and she&#39;s one of the true great champions of public schools, kids, and teachers.</description>

      <description>I think it&#39;s time for me to start developing a CS Ethics class.
An ethics course isn&#39;t a replacement for having teachers that live and model good behavior and weave ethical issues throughout the curriculum but still, adding a separate course on top of that has its merits.
I&#39;m not in a rush to create this course. I might be done in a month or it might take a couple of years.</description>

      <description>In addition to everything I wrote about last time there were a couple of other big announcements at this year&#39;s CSTA conference. Both announcements deal with funding.
First, there is a new class of CSTA membership. The free tier remains but now for $50 you can join CSTA+. This new level of membership comes with a bunch of extras that are probably good for K12 teachers but I doubt I&#39;ll use any of them.</description>

      <description>While busy finishing off my sides for my talk at CSTA2018 this weekend I noticed a Facebook post about APCS exam grades now or shortly being available.
I&#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher first and part of the K12CS community. We&#39;re a growing community and we&#39;re growing fast.
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their results. &#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I&#39;ve been a member of CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I&#39;ve made it to the annual conference.
The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech conference.</description>

Yes! I love SIGCSE and CSTA. I just feel like.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s been a lively discussion on pushback to CS for All at the K12 level over on Facebook. Mark Guzdial started a sub thread asking if CS for All should first be implemented at the undergrad level rather than K12.
It&#39;s an interesting question and as good as anything to get me out of my month long non-blogging rut.
Mark was right when he said that if Colleges implement CS for All, K12 will likely do so to follow - just look at AP.</description>

      <description>The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &#34;How do I assess CS?&#34; I wanted to go but it&#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped out. Fortunately, the meetup was recorded. I was able to watch the first half this morning while working out on my stationary trainer which leads me to today&#39;s rare Saturday morning blog post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12 teachers who taught CS.</description>

      <description>Alfred Thompson wrote about CS education tools earlier today. I&#39;ve also been meaning to write on the topic but from a different point of view.
I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&#39;s not really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work on I&#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent technology.</description>

I&#39;ve had and any number of concerns though.
This past week at the inaugural meeting of New York City&#39;s CSTA chapter we got a taste of the NYC CS4All Blueprint.</description>

I still have a few summer topics I want to write about -- standards and side projects in particular but I&#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the classroom since, after all, at my core, I&#39;m a teacher.

&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) July 7, 2017 
I always use that line to emphasize that I teach CS - a way of thinking and problem solving and looking at the world. The languages we use in our classes are tools to help us communicate ideas not the ends but rather a means.</description>

      <description>AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&#39;t, some don&#39;t really care.
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
Don&#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.
I never really cared much about my students&#39; actual AP scores.</description>

      <description>As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the conference of the ACM&#39;s Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the proceedings and read many of the papers.
 Now that I&#39;m at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday.</description>

 Just completed the second time through for my Software Development course. Last year we had a great time at our Demo Night hosted at Google.  This year, unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, we couldn&#39;t get the event together. Still, the kids did great work so I thought I&#39;d share.  This year, I asked each group to make a short video.  First up, we&#39;ve got bit&amp;lt;&amp;lt;shift - a search engine for code.</description>

      <description>The subtitle of this post is:
 and why my students are going to hate me tomorrow.
 When my good friend Gerry Seidman talks to my classes, he frequently says &amp;ldquo;never use a data structure or algorithm you couldn&amp;rsquo;t build yourself.&amp;rdquo;
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have to write everything from scratch, just that you should have some knowledge as to what&amp;rsquo;s going on under the hood. I find that all too often young programmers just rely on APIs and libraries and really don&amp;rsquo;t know how their computers and programs are working.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.

The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it&#39;s as good a time as any to try to resurrect this blog.  As you can see, I&#39;ve moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted on Github. I&#39;m really liking the way it works but more on that at a later date.</description>

      <description>Anyone can cook - Chef GusteauThese days the rage seems anyone can code.
On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.
We&#39;ve got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth &#34;learn to code&#34; efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.
While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been mostly underwater for the last couple of weeks.
End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.
It&#39;s going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I&#39;d put up this short semi-related post.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I attended the K-12 workshop at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. It was great to reconnect with some old friends, make some new ones, and talk shop for the weekend.
One result was that I promised to start blogging again.
I&#39;ve got a number of ideas for posts lined up. Some on pedagogy, some technical, and some cultural. Hope you enjoy them.</description>

      <description>Just a short follow up on the last post.
In thinking about how I frequently programs, once I have a plan, I work on one part of the project, and then ask myself &#34;what&#39;s next?&#34; That is, what is the next step towards completion.
It reminded me about a guest speaker we had a about a year and a half ago at one of our &#34;professional development&#34; days. For the past two years, our school has had &#34;</description>

      <description>One evening, many years ago, when I was in college, I had an epiphany. Maybe not as enlightening as the epiphany I had while watching &#34;The Mummy Returns&#34;&amp;nbsp; many years later, but that&#39;s a story for another day.
While working on some class project, I realized that soon, within a couple of&amp;nbsp; years, I&#39;d be working for a real company and I&#39;d actually have to write code that REALLY works. Not just something that gets past the grader, or answers all the test cases.</description>
