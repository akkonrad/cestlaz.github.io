      <title>Hunter Launches CS Teacher Certification Programs</title>

      <description>It took a while but we&amp;#39;re finally here. Hunter College is launching it&amp;#39;s Computer Science Teacher Certification programs. This was the second big initiative I&amp;#39;ve been working on at Hunter. The first was the Daedalus undergraduate CS scholars program. The Daedalus program started my first year and is now providing the best value (and in my opinion best) undergraduate CS opportunity in New York.  CS Certification took longer. I had to design the programs, they had to make it through the whole CUNY governance process which even under ideal circumstances takes around a year and then up through NYSED.</description>

      <title>Communicating With Students - maybe GitHub to the rescue</title>

      <description>Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are plenty of options:    Piazza    Facebook group    Slack, Discord, or other chat system    Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system    Mailing list    but all have warts.  I shared my thoughts on a number of these options a while ago but thought I&amp;#39;d update them now.</description>

      <description>When I wrote about the HighWebEd I mentioned John William&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s talk on Agile. He spoke about how the movie Airplane! was filmed in an Agile manner and gave as an example the development of the &amp;#34;jive&amp;#34; scenes.  &amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;#34;560&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;315&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdCjbJ6NEfc&amp;#34; frameborder=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; allow=&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;  Apparently the creative team had a script but it wasn&amp;#39;t working. The first pair that read for the role, Norman Gibbs and Al White had their owned take.</description>

      <title>Cheating on CS projects</title>

      <description>Alfred Thompson posted today about cheating on CS class projects. It was in response to Garth Flint&amp;#39;s post on finding interesting projects which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.  Garth laments that it&amp;#39;s hard to find projects that are both interesting and meaty but where solutions can&amp;#39;t easily be searched for online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&amp;#39;s an ethics issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&amp;#39;m not naive enough to believe there isn&amp;#39;t any cheating in my classes.</description>

      <title>Pig Latin - a beginner lesson with some depth</title>

      <description>I recently did a unit where I had my students convert words into Pig Latin. I like the problem because to start it only requires strings, functions and if statements but there is some depth to the unit.  We start with simplified rules:    If the word starts with a vowel, add &amp;#34;ay&amp;#34; to the end of the word    If it starts with a consonant move the first latter to the end and add &amp;#34;ay&amp;#34;    don&amp;#39;t worry about anything else    Students usually start with something like this:    as students realize it&amp;#39;s much easier to check for vowels rather than consonants.</description>

      <title>Advanced CS Early - Are they learning it or just using it?</title>

      <description>I recently took a look at the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. It&amp;#39;s a series of challenges through which you can learn all about crypto and crypto attacks. They say they&amp;#39;ll eventually have solutions but since the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&amp;#39;ll ever publish them.  One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges.</description>

      <description>I was planning on writing up all the exciting CS Education work I got to be involved in these past two days but I saw a post on one of the CS discussion forums that got me riled.  There&amp;#39;s a teacher (name withheld to protect the innocent) who wants to create an advanced course for his students but his administration is requesting an outside measure of accountability. This sounds reasonable on the surface but I found it really insulting.</description>

      <title>Big Code And Case Studies</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m enjoying reading about Ria Galanos&amp;#39; new chapter on her blog. In her most recent post Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.</description>

      <description>No,I&amp;#39;m not talking aboutArgument from Authority - something that very much plagues CS Education and education in general where an annointed few who may, or may not really know what they&amp;#39;re talking about are given creedence because they&amp;#39;ve been there the longest, work for the companies with the biggest names, have the economic backing or otherwise have been given the stage.  I&amp;#39;m talking about Proof by Authority which I fondly remember from those silly Proof techniques lists that went around in the day.</description>

      <title>Year in Review - the classes</title>

      <description>Now that the semester&amp;#39;s over I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to reflect a bit on my teaching over the past year.  This year I taught two classes each semester so the load was a little higher. First semester was one class of our CS0 and one of the lab/enrichment component that goes with CS1. Nothing big to report there as I&amp;#39;ve done them both before.  The biggest difference was that I had to deal with two separate classes even though they&amp;#39;re one cohort.</description>

      <description>Someone mentioned Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava in one of the CS educator Facbeook groups. It looked interesting so I thought I&amp;#39;d give it a once over.  It&amp;#39;s certainly an accessible book. Text mixed with cute line drawings, &amp;#34;hand written&amp;#34; text, diagrams and picture.s It reminded me of one of my favorite, most accessible Calculus books Who Was Fourier.  Overall I enjoyed the book but I&amp;#39;m not sure what its best audience is.</description>

      <description>Reading Garth Flint&amp;#39;s end of year post and Alfred Thompson&amp;#39;s follow up had me thinking about a couple of things.  One was spurred when Garth wrote &amp;#34;They also have to figure out the math before they code.&amp;#34; This made me think about all the details we sometimes take for for granted. Things that are hard for our students that we just know. It&amp;#39;s frequently math that we might find trivial but it could also be much simpler things.</description>

      <title>AP Classes, Placing Students, and First Topic Exposures</title>

      <description>Just like last year, I&amp;#39;m taking in two classes worth of students in to my honors program. The challenge is that I can only teach two classes and I&amp;#39;ve got to figure out what to teach and then which students belong in which class.  It basically comes down to one of two courses, our CS0 (CSCI127) and our CS1 (CSCI135).  CSCI127 is a first programming experience. The normal class is taught as a large lecture with small recitation/labs.</description>

      <title>The Hunter Daedalus Fall 2019 recruiting class</title>

      <description>Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&amp;#39;d share some information on Hunter&amp;#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.  I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&amp;#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&amp;#39;t exist.</description>
