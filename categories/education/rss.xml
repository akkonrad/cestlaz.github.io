      <description>I spent yesterday evening at the Cooper Union in their Great Hall, a place famous for Abraham Lincoln&#39;s speech that some say propelled him to the presidency.
I was there in the audience watching as the Sloan Foundation and the Fund for the City of New York awarded seven public school teachers with an ward for &#34;Excellence in the Teaching of Science and Mathematics.&#34;
I was their to see my friend Dave Deutsch, a long time public school physics teacher receive the honor.</description>

      <description>I saw this tweet the day along with the ensuing thread:
Seriously, who emails a professor with words like &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plz hlp&amp;quot;? Am I allowed to put language in my syllabus that penalizes students for obnoxious, intentional misspellings? Maybe: -1% to your course grade multiplied by the edit distance of the word with its correction?

I wanted to reply but as usual, I decided to reply in a blog post so that it doesn&#39;t get lost in the Twitterverse.</description>
