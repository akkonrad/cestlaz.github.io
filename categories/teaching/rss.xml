      <title>Varying Remote Teaching</title>

      <description>When we first went remote I jumped on Zoom. I already new the technology and it most simulated a live class. Basically, it was the best combination if quick, easy, and effective and we were under the gun to get something going and give our students some sense of normalcy and continuity.  As we settled in though, it made sense to try some different things. One was the &amp;#34;lab packet.</description>

      <description>I was reading Mary Clair Wright&amp;#39;s new blog the other day. It&amp;#39;s always great to see another teacher sharing publicly online.  One line caught my eye in her latest post -  &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; Remote instruction is weird, I can’t see them. I have to trust that they will message me with questions. &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;  This is a real problem. It&amp;#39;s hard enough in a regular class where we can pick up an all sorts of cues and use all sorts formal and informal assessments but when the students are on the other end of a teleconference or even more challenging an email or chat it&amp;#39;s even harder.</description>

      <title>Limitations Of Remote Teaching</title>

      <description>While tools like Zoom, Slack and others are a tremendous boon as we&amp;#39;re forced to do all our teaching remotely the limitations become apparent as we settle in and try to go beyond the basics of an offsite meeting.  Today was code review day in my CS1 class. It&amp;#39;s a lesson that I enjoy teaching and I think my students get a lot out of it. Today we had to do it remote.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;#39;t expect to read a Fred Wilson post on teaching online but that&amp;#39;s what I found when I visited his blog this morning. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong - I suspect that Fred has the makings of a great teacher, it&amp;#39;s just not what I expected to find. There have been many posts about education but I don&amp;#39;t recall any about teaching or more specifically the art of teaching. I did find this post though which actually speaks to some of the thoughts today&amp;#39;s post got churning.</description>

      <description>I organize a monthly professional development session for CS teachers. It&amp;#39;s targeted at teachers who are beyond the beginner stage and don&amp;#39;t want yet another hello world blinky arduino scratch workshop. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, given the need for CS teachers we need plenty of beginner workshops but we also need to take teachers to the next level. I refer to my workshops as being for teachers of APCS-A, similar, or beyond.</description>

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers - part 2 - the report</title>

      <description>Continuing from yesterday, what about the article and report on pay and free teacher resources.  The report looked at three sources - one pay and two free. They came up with a number of results but I think they largely missed the point.  Their bottom line conclusion was that &amp;#39;Overall, reviewers rate most of the materials as “mediocre” or “probably not worth using”.&amp;#39; They also didn&amp;#39;t seem to find that neither the for profit or free sources were universally better.</description>

      <title>Teachers Pay Teachers  - part 1 - should they</title>

      <description>There was a bit of buzz a couple of months ago when Amazon announced an online marketplace for educational resources. It wasn&amp;#39;t a new concept - on the pay side, Teachers Pay Teachers has been around for a while and in terms of free, there are many online resources but they&amp;#39;re not necessarily well organized or curated. What was the buzz? Should teachers be charging their peers for class materials or should they be providing them for free.</description>

      <title>Using GitHub issues for class communicatoin</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/git-issues/</link>

      <description>Last week I talked about using GitHub issues as a mechanism for class communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and also felt that a video would be better than text.  So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class communication. I don&amp;#39;t show examples of everything like @ tagging but I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.</description>

      <description>I run periodic professional development sessions here in New York with my partner in crime JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver. I call them PD for &amp;#34;APCS-A, similar or beyond&amp;#34; and they&amp;#39;re designed to fill a professional development gap. We try to run them once a month but it&amp;#39;s a little less frequent than that.  The NYCDOE has taken on the monster task of CS for all and since they&amp;#39;re trying to get to everyone they have to run a bazillion sessions but all at an introductory level.</description>

      <title>Early Ap Registration - it&#39;s, um, for the kids</title>

      <description>I stumbled upon a thread over in the APCS-A Facebook group the other day. It seems that the College Board is making some changes in their registration timeline. In the past, students registered for the exam sometime in March with the exams administered in May. The new changes include requiring registration in November along with $40 late registration and cancellation fees.  The College Board is, of course, spinning this as for the student&amp;#39;s benefit.</description>

      <title>From Scripts To Freestyle</title>

      <description>I just read this post by Bethany Crystal - Going off script.  Bethany writes that while she normally essentially scripts important presentations, this time she went more off the cuff.  It made me think about how I teach and a disturbing trend I&amp;#39;ve seen in CS education and education in general.  I&amp;#39;ve never strictly used a script for teaching. When I started I did use very detailed lesson plans.</description>

      <description>If you check out Twitter, Facebook, Medium and other blog sites you might get the idea that you&amp;#39;re the worst teacher in the world. The internet abounds with people sharing tweets and posts about wonderful lessons they&amp;#39;ve just taught, witnessed or learned about in professional development. Sure, the teacher forums rife with requests for lesson ideas and resources but the shared material is always aces.  It makes sense, people in the community want to share things that worked for them or things they think will work.</description>
