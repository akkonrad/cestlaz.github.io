      <description>Following up on my last post I thought I&#39;d talk a bit more about course development. According to most powers that be it&#39;s all done ahead of time. Organizations and companies with curricula to sell package it all up ahead of time lesson by lesson unit by unit. When I create a new course at Hunter, they demand a sample syllabus during the approval process with a week by week outline, assignments reading and more.</description>

      <description>I spent a couple of days last week hunkered down working designing a CS Ethics course and of course it got me thinking about designing courses in general.
One of the topics I&#39;ve ranted on is my disdain for canned curricula. I&#39;ve never been a fan. This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t want to leverage other people&#39;s work. I&#39;ll take sample curricula, lessons, and all the resources I can get my hands on but I&#39;d never just deliver them as is.</description>
