      <title>When does a new course really get developed</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/when-does-a-new-course-get-developed/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Following up on my last post I thought I&amp;#39;d talk a bit more about
course development. According to most powers that be it&amp;#39;s all done
ahead of time. Organizations and companies with curricula to sell
package it all up ahead of time lesson by lesson unit by unit. When
I create a new course at Hunter, they demand a sample syllabus during
the approval process with a week by week outline, assignments reading
and more. When I created CAPE for Google back in 2010 even though the
programs man advocate knew the real deal he and I spoke many times
about needing something on paper to satisfy the higher ups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To me most of this is nonsense. When I create a new course I have an
idea and a direction but little else. Of course there&amp;#39;s much work to
be done between idea and implementation but for me  a detailed
curriculum that early is mostly a waste of time. Why? Because it all
changes once you get in the classroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll do the bare minimum to get by the gatkeepers. If they want a week
to week, I give them a week to week but I won&amp;#39;t stress over it. I
then get to work on what I feel I need prior to running a course. A
framework and the first few lessons in detail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Developing the framework means:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
understanding enough of the content to teach the course. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
deciding on how you will teach or run the course
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
developing rough outlines for units, possible assignments etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
finding and understanding resources like possible texts and tools
and also things like data sources mentioned in my previous post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And of course there&amp;#39;s more. I&amp;#39;ll also work out the first unit in day
by day detail. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another important aspect is that this framework design is where you
put in your safety nets. What&amp;#39;s the backup plan if unit 2 takes too
long or students just aren&amp;#39;t getting unit 3. Another important aspect
is to prepare too much material. In my experience it usually takes
longer to teach something than you originally plan but I still think
it&amp;#39;s better to plan too much rather than too little.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why do I only plan out the first unit in details? Because i know
things will change once the rubber hits the road. Even if it doesn&amp;#39;t
change, developing specific lessons without regard to your current
students seems rather odd. It reminds me of how &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bill-irwin.com/&#34;&gt;Bill Irwin&lt;/a&gt; learned his
role in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Men_Out&#34;&gt;Eight Men Out&lt;/a&gt;. Irwin&amp;#39;s amazing but apparently never played
baseball. He played Eddie Collins, the White Sox second
baseman. Having not played himself, his action scenes were
choreographed like a dance. The director would yell action and he&amp;#39;d do
his dance. If the ball happened to go where it was supposed to you
ended up with a bang bang play. If not, cut, retake. It worked for the
movie but it&amp;#39;s not a great idea for a teacher. How can you plan day 5
of a class when the first four days and all the richness of the live
classes and time between hasn&amp;#39;t occurred. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course this means a lot of work under the gun but no one ever said
that developing a new course was easy. It&amp;#39;s reassuring that I&amp;#39;m not
the only one who does the real class development in real time:
&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/guzdial?ref_src=twsrc&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/guzdial?ref_src=twsrc&lt;/a&gt;%5Etfw&amp;#34;&amp;gt;@guzdial&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, we are using GP as the main language.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally having survived the first run through it&amp;#39;s time to &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway&#34;&gt;throw it
away&lt;/a&gt;. Not really but it&amp;#39;s time to take lessons learned and work them
into the class. From there, it&amp;#39;s incremental improvements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there you have it, a summary of my approach to course creation.

      <title>Owning The Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/owning-the-curriculum/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I spent a couple of days last week hunkered down working designing a
CS Ethics course and of course it got me thinking about designing
courses in general. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the topics I&amp;#39;ve ranted on is my disdain for canned
curricula. I&amp;#39;ve never been a fan. This isn&amp;#39;t to say I don&amp;#39;t want to
leverage other people&amp;#39;s work. I&amp;#39;ll take sample curricula, lessons, and
all the resources I can get my hands on but I&amp;#39;d never just deliver
them as is. Even back when I started as a math teacher and I had the
NYCDOE lesson plan books to use as samples, I&amp;#39;d use those lessons as
sources to develop my own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was reminded why I do this as I was developing my ethics course. I
want the course to have a significant amount of programming and for
some of the projects US census data and the NYC data mine look to be
good sources of data. I was led to these sources from some project
ideas I found online but those projects provided the data pre
processed. Had I been using these sources as a canned curriculum
things would be fine until something changed. Either the resource went
away or the direction of the class required something different. In
either event, had I been happy to merely use someone elses canned
materials I wouldn&amp;#39;t be prepared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that you&amp;#39;ve got to do some digging before you can
effectively use a resource like the US census data. Maybe you can use
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml%5D&#34;&gt;American Fact Finder&lt;/a&gt;. With it you can download a refined data set
as a CSV but you&amp;#39;ll still have to figure out how to use the tool and
which data sets you need. Another approach is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-via-ftp.html&#34;&gt;download the data via
FTP&lt;/a&gt; but then you have to figure out how the files are arranged. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that you can&amp;#39;t just go to census.gov and
trivially get what you need and you certainly can&amp;#39;t just send students
there and say &amp;#34;good luck.&amp;#34; I spent more hours that I&amp;#39;d care to admit
last week figuring out the ins and outs of a variety of data sources
and I&amp;#39;ve got many more hours ahead. It&amp;#39;s taking a lot of time but at
the end of the day, I&amp;#39;ll own the knowledge. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the day the first time you offer a course most of your
pre planning is going to go out the window. You need a framework, a
direction, and a start but first time through you don&amp;#39;t know how or
where things will really go. If you&amp;#39;re using someone else material,
good luck when things take an unexpected turn. If you own the course,
you&amp;#39;ll be prepared.
&lt;/p&gt;
