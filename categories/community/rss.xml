      <description>A couple of weeks ago, a handful of CS Ed folks got together. One issue we discussed was that of finding CS related events both for students and teachers.
One of our conveners, Dan Fenjves of UPPERLINE CODE talked about possibly hosting a central site. Today, Dan announced http://csevents.nyc/. A site where organizers can submit and students and teachers can find upcoming events. Right now it&#39;s NY centric but it does list some events beyond the city.</description>

      <description>Amy Ko posted this yesterday:
CSEd people: many have struggled to use Twitter for discussion. How about Twitter for broadcasting, but when replies turn to discussion, we use https://t.co/2oivuriOoU? It&amp;#39;s a better (albeit imperfect) platform for civil discourse. Subreddit mods @AustinCorgiBart @zamansky?

I&#39;d love to see more traffic there. For full disclosure, I&#39;m one of the moderators but in my defense, I&#39;m not much of a moderator and as Cory said, I too am happy to either keep moderating or to step aside.</description>

      <title>Presenting At CSTA 2020</title>

      <description>Presenting at CSTA 2020 I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&#39;d be presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference held every July.
A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&#39;s presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.
It&#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous before presentations even though we present every day as part of our jobs. I know it&#39;s different as we have the same kids every day but even day 1 jitters each semester aren&#39;t the same as the presentation anxiety that some of us face.</description>

      <description>One of the side benefits of visiting high schools is that I end up going all over the city. This takes me to neighborhoods that I normally wouldn&#39;t have reason to visit. For a New York History wonk that can be pretty cool even if you just limit yourself to looking at the schools. A few of the schools I visited in the last couple of weeks before the new year were self contained whole building schools:</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving weekend is also reunion weekend. I&#39;ve been on and off invited to Stuy reunions over the years. Not as often it seems as some teachers but more often than others. I always do my best to attend. I have very fond memories of many students and many classes over many years and think a lot about them so feel very honored whenever I&#39;m invited to one of these.
In the past each class due a reunion did its own thing - some club or bar usually in Manhattan.</description>

      <title>Challenges of teaching at a commuter school</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/commuter-school/</link>

      <description>One of the bigger challenges faced at commuter schools is building a feeling of community. Students aren&#39;t on campus every day and come from far afield and even when they are on campus, we really don&#39;t have a CS &#34;hang out&#34; space. The space issue should be resolved soon - we&#39;re scheduled to get a CS student lounge next semester.
I&#39;m finding this to be even more of a challenge this year with my honors students.</description>
