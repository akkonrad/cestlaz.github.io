      <description>It&#39;s that time of the year to write a series of blog posts about SIGCSE. I thought I&#39;d start with one on the keynotes.
There were four keynote speakers. Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend, Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&#39;t at the first timer&#39;s lunch where Townsend spoke so I won&#39;t talk at all about that keynote.
I&#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific summary of his SIGCSE experience and did a much better job giving overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&#39;ll just refer you to Andy&#39;s blog post.</description>
