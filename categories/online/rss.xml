      <description>I&#39;ve been seeing some tweets over the past couple of days about the wonders of online teaching. How it&#39;s at least as good or better than in person or how we should have been doing it all along.
Rubbish.
If you say that online is better than in person that says more about the (low) quality of your teaching than it does about the quality of online tech teaching resources.</description>
