      <description>Today I got to be a judge at StuyHacks VI. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been a judge there, I&#39;ve been doing it for a few years now. I&#39;ve also been lucky enought to have been asked to judge a handful of other local hackathons over the years.
StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at Stuyvesant High School. Since it&#39;s run by students, the cast of organizers regularly changes.</description>
