      <description>As many of you know, the CS Education programs I designed here at Hunter were finally approved by NY State late last year. We&#39;re planning to get started this summer. I&#39;ve received many questions about the program and will write up the details here sooner or later but one question I frequently get is &#34;will it be offered online?&#34; This is also something I&#39;ve been asked more than once internal to Hunter.</description>

      <title>Clojurescript - building a simple router</title>

      <description>In this video we&#39;ll look at creating a small router.
I originally looked at using one of the available libraries to set up routing. I considered reitit and bidi but in the end decided to figure out how to do it myself.
It turns out that whenever you change the hash part of a url - everything following a # at the end of a url you get a ~hashchange~ event.</description>

      <description>Every few years the experts give us some new magic bullet, some new teaching fad research based pedagogical technique. Teachers are trained in it, forced to use it - frequently as a one size fits all. If we do, we&#39;re good teachers, if we don&#39;t we get the dreaded ineffective on our annual ratings.
I was reminded of this when reading Mark Guzdial&#39;s recent blog post on things he got wrong in Computing Education.</description>

      <description>I got some positive feedback from my first Clojurescript post and video so I thought I&#39;d continue with the series.
Here we&#39;ll continue to build a simple Clojurescript/Shadow-cljs/Reagent/Tailwindcss application by creating some reusable components. It&#39;s one of the things that make Clojurescript so nice for web development.
Here&#39;s a link to the GitHub repo with the code: https://github.com/zamansky/shadow-cljs-demo</description>

      <description>Yesterday was, I think the fourth, To Code and Beyond conference hosted by Diane Levitt at Cornell Technion. I might blog about a few of the talks but for today let&#39;s start with one.
In spite of my anti College Board bias, I really enjoyed Barbara Ericson&#39;s talk on APCS statistics. Barbara&#39;s been breaking down the APCS numbers for years - how many took the exam(s), how many passed them. By state, gender, etc.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing with ClojureScipt for my web projects recently and really like it. Much more fun than any of the JavaScript frameworks I&#39;ve used.
Still, getting started was somewhat difficult due to the number of options in tooling and uneven documentation and learning resources.
Here&#39;s a video that shows how I use Emacs for ClojureScript development but the focus of the video is on how to get started with ClojureScript and Emacs takes a back seat other than an example of my workflow.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a big fan of GitHub Classroom and use it for all of my class assignments. It&#39;s great for organizing, distributing, and collecting assignments and gets the kids used to using real world tools at the same time. I&#39;ve written a bunch of posts on how I use it:

      <description>On the last day of 2019, Audrey Waters wrote a great piece on The 100 Worst Ed-Tech Debacles of the Decade. I agree with most of them but felt it was worth looking at a one in particular. Specifically number 6 - &#34;Everyone Should earn to Code.&#34; I might dive in to some others later but we&#39;ll stick with number 6 for today.
I read over these right after reading two recent posts by Alina Adam&#39;s son Gregory - a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School over on Alina&#39;s blog questioning NYC&#39;s CS For All initiative.</description>

      <description>Happy new year to everyone.
I&#39;ve been reading some prediction posts this morning on blogs and social media. Big national and world level stuff. I&#39;ve never been much for predictions so I thought I&#39;d share some more local and personal things I&#39;m looking forward to in the coming year.
First a couple of big ones.
I&#39;m just about to complete my fourth year at Hunter. Time really does fly. It&#39;s been a long road but late in 2019 NY State finally approved our CS Teacher Certification programs!</description>

      <description>I read Doug Peterson&#39;s post this moirning on his 10 years blogging. I realized that I&#39;m also finishing off my 10th year of doing the same. I also noticed that for a second year in a row, I&#39;ve eclipsed 100 posts. That&#39;s an average of a bit under 2 posts a week which is more than I thought particularly when it feels like I go through multi weeks stretches without writing anything.</description>

      <description>People say that one of the impossible problems for CS teachers is keeping current - they say the field is constantly changing, how can a teacher keep up with all the new things going on.
Well, on the one hand it isn&#39;t true - most of the core of CS is the same. We still teach roughly the same programming constructs, data structures and algorithms.
On the other hand, it is true.</description>

      <description>In the real world you&#39;re usually not building your own projects from scratch. Much more frequently you&#39;re working on a team and you and other players come and go over time.
This is in stark contrast to most CS educational experiences where students typically complete relatively small assignments from beginning to end. One of my biggest fears way back when as I was about to graduate college was when I woke up one night in a cold sweath &#34;</description>

      <description>As I sad in my last post, day 8 would be a nice project or lesson in an APCS-A or college CS1 class. Another nice problem would be to write a program to generate an image in the format required by the question. Alternatively, a teacher doing day 8 with their classes might want to generate a bunch of images for the students to test their decoders on.
I thought I&#39;d write one to see how appropriate it would be for the students.</description>

      <description>I spent most of last week up in Albany working on the NY State K12 CS Standards so fell a bit behind. I had to go back to complete day 5 but still haven&#39;t finished day 7 which builds on day 5 which in turn builds on day 2. I might not get to finishing 7 for a while but it looks like a good chance to play with core.async - Clojure&#39;s facilities for concurrency.</description>

      <description>Day 4. Most of the day was spent working on the NY State CS standards to I didn&#39;t figure to have much time to work on the problem. Fortunately, I was able to knock out part 1 before work started and part 2 was a quick adjustment when I got back to it at the start of lunch.
Once again, it was a problem with a few interesting teacher side aspects.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s problem dealt with intersecting paths. You start with two inputs, figure out the paths they represent and where they intersect and then find the intersection that correctly answers the question.
For part 1 you have to find the intersection closest to the origin. From a teacher&#39;s point of view, the interesting part here is data representation. This problem deals with a two dimensional grid on which the paths live. For most students, at least in my experience, if they&#39;re trained in a language like C++ or Java they go for the direct representation - a 2D array.</description>

      <description>Day 2 of Advent of Code 2019 was also pretty straightforward and once again I wrote my solution in Clojure but in order to talk about this from a teacher&#39;s point of view, we&#39;ll look at a Python solution.
At its core, this is a simulation problem - read the data into an array or list and write a program to run through the steps. At first I was hoping that the solution would consume the data - that is, once you read past an instruction you don&#39;t go back to it.</description>

      <description>Like most programming challenges, Advent of Code ramps out from easier, more accessible problems to harder, more complex ones. As such, a number of the early challenges are great problems for early CS students.
I thought that while I watched my NY Giants play valiantly in their attempt to get a high draft pick I&#39;d talk about today&#39;s challenge from a teacher&#39;s point of view.
The summary of part one is that you have a list of inputs (masses of components) and for each one you have to perform a calculation (how much fuel is needed).</description>

      <description>It&#39;s almost December which means it&#39;s almost time for Advent of Code 2019. Advent of code is an annual computer programming competition created and ruyn by Eric Wastl. It&#39;s been running since 2015. I&#39;ve written about it before, mostly from a teacher&#39;s point of view (Solve A to Solve B, Data structures and Hidden Complexity, Tools can shape how we think and a few others).
Basically, Eric releases one poblem a day at midnight from Dec 1 through Dec 25.</description>

      <description>Presenting at CSTA 2020 I noticed a few tweets and posts from people announcing that they&#39;d be presenting at CSTA2020 - the big computer science teachers conference held every July.
A common thread in a few of these were trepidation&#39;s presenters. Excited to be doing this but nervous.
It&#39;s interesting that teachers, myself included, sometimes get nervous before presentations even though we present every day as part of our jobs. I know it&#39;s different as we have the same kids every day but even day 1 jitters each semester aren&#39;t the same as the presentation anxiety that some of us face.</description>

      <description>At this point, we&#39;ve done a fair amount of playing with text so it&#39;s time for a fun little project. We&#39;re going to generate some text &#34;in the style&#34; of a source text. The technique we&#39;re going to use is usually called a Markov Chain text generator. Basically a model where the next state or word is based entirely on the current state. I don&#39;t dwell on the math under the hood but in case you&#39;re interested, here are a few links: Wikipedia, Explained Visually, UC Davis Math.</description>

      <description>When I was writing the I Speak Jive post, the first thing I had to do was find those old programs. It turned out to be harder than I thought. I found online versions but it took a while to find this GitHub repo.
On the way, I seemed to recall that these might be bundled with a bunch of old BSD games so I took a look at the BSD games package for Linux.</description>

      <description>Following up on a previous post, we&#39;re going to continue to talk about playing with text. This time, building and working with a bag of words from a text.
A bag of words is a simple language processing model where you just consider individual words in a text. What they are and how many times they occur. This is a pretty simple model but you can still have a good bit of fun with your students with it.</description>

      <description>Ever since I started looking at Magit as a &#34;git dashboard&#34; instead of as a &#34;git interface&#34; it&#39;s been yet another Emacs killer app to me. I just recently started playing with forge which allows Magit to interface and interact with git &#34;forges&#34; like GitHub. This allows you to work on issues and pull requests without ever leaving Emacs.
Here&#39;s a video on how easy it is. The video doesn&#39;t show this but the first time you fire forge up it will prompt you for credentials.</description>

      <description>Last week I talked about using GitHub issues as a mechanism for class communication. I thought it might be helpful to follow up on it and also felt that a video would be better than text.
So, here it is, 16 minutes on how you can use GitHub issues for class communication. I don&#39;t show examples of everything like @ tagging but I think it shows some of the power of using GitHub and GitHub classroom beyond just a software repo and versioning.</description>

      <description>By living in Emacs I get a consistent interface across all sorts of tasks - programming, lesson planning, making presentations, preparing documents, and yes, even email. I&#39;ve been using mu4e as my Emacs email client for a while now. Currently, I&#39;m using Emacs for my work email and Gmail for personal. I&#39;ve been thinking of going whole hog to mu4e and possibly migrating from Gmail to a new email provider for the personal stuff but there are still a few pain points with Emacs email:</description>

I call them PD for &#34;APCS-A, similar or beyond&#34; and they&#39;re designed to fill a professional development gap. We try to run them once a month but it&#39;s a little less frequent than that.
The NYCDOE has taken on the monster task of CS for all and since they&#39;re trying to get to everyone they have to run a bazillion sessions but all at an introductory level.</description>

      <description>Out of class student communication is always a challenge. There are plenty of options:
 Piazza Facebook group Slack, Discord, or other chat system Discourse, Vanilla or other discussion forum system Mailing list  but all have warts.
I shared my thoughts on a number of these options a while ago but thought I&#39;d update them now.
Most of my opinions hold form my earlier post. I was using and continue to use a mailing list as I can be pretty sure that students will get the email and they don&#39;t have to go to any outside site or application.</description>

      <description>When I wrote about the HighWebEd I mentioned John William&#39;&#39;s talk on Agile. He spoke about how the movie Airplane! was filmed in an Agile manner and gave as an example the development of the &#34;jive&#34; scenes.

Apparently the creative team had a script but it wasn&#39;t working. The first pair that read for the role, Norman Gibbs and Al White had their owned take. Not only dir the team cast them on the spot and follow their creative lead (hence Agile) but they also apparently apologized to the two actors as the original attempt was so bad compared t what Gibbs and White brought to the table.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time at area high schools this fall. Today I was at FDR High School in Broooklyn.
  I only learned about FDR HS a little over a year ago when I met their CS teacher Josh Hans at a NYC PD event. I visit last fall and then again today.
Whenever I visit a school it&#39;s a different experience. Sometimes I speak to the CS classes, sometimes at an event like a CS Week hackathon, once I even got to address an entire senior class in an auditorium.</description>

      <description>I started to work on a web application the other day. It&#39;s nothing special but if I ever finish it, it will be a pretty complete project. The backend will be a REST API and I&#39;m planning on writing the frontend in Clojurescript.
The problem with developing a web application like this is that you can&#39;t really write the front end until you have enough of the backend to provide data.</description>

If you are a software developer/engineer, please reply with a trait (or traits) that you look for in hiring new engineers (new grads). This can be something you glean from a resume, technical interview, behavorial interview, or all of the above.

      <description>Org-mode is my markup of choice. I spend the vast majority of my time working on text files working in org-mode. Since GitHUb started rendering org-mode files in their site I&#39;ve also used org-mode for things like Readme files in my projects. I even force it on my students at times. When I make an assignment, I seed it with an org-mode file that they have to modify - that is - fill in things like their names, group members etc.</description>

Most attendees were college web developers or designers along people who run web operations at colleges and universities and related vendors. Being a CS teacher, I was a bit of an outsider but still got a lot out of the conference.
It was our first time in Milwuakee so we had to see some sights.</description>

Results from Longitudinal Study of Female Persistence in CS: AP CS matters, After-school programs and Internships do not https://t.co/GOzp3045Hp
&amp;mdash; Mark Guzdial (@guzdial) October 14, 2019 
I&#39;m glad Mark wrote about this as it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to both research and publicize but it&#39;s really not a surprise.
I&#39;m going to start by dismissing the statement that &#34;... participation in the Aspirations awards program were teh best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors.</description>

      <description>I was working on writing a midterm the other day so figured I&#39;d talk a bit about my test grading policy.
Before getting to the specifics, let me set the stage. I spent most of my career at Stuyvesant - a public magnet school in NYC. There are many great students who are interested in learning but there&#39;s also a focus on grades. and this leads to a non-insignificant portion of the student body that is grade obsessed and will do everything and anything for every point possible.</description>

      <description>Or, as Wayne Gretzky said &#34;You miss 100% of the shots you don&#39;t take.&#34;
Why do I mention this?
Because I&#39;ve been hearing way too often from young people who are too quick to deny themselves opportunities and too often these are from students who have come from less advantaged backgrounds.
It&#39;s Fall and I&#39;ve been making my rounds visiting local schools to talk to seniors about colleges in general and Hunter CS in particular.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been wanting to check out lsp-mode under Emacs for a while now. LSP stands for Language Protocol Service. The idea is that you have a standard interface between your editor and some language server. If you program in multiple languages and each has an LSP server you end up, in theory, with a simpler configuration and a consistent interface.
This certainly sounds more appealing than how we did it in the old days where you have some ad hoc configuraiton for each language you work in.</description>

Here are three awards, two of which are open for nominations / applications now. If you know someone deserving, nominate them. I&#39;m guessing students don&#39;t really know about the Cutler-Bell award so if you have any deserving students, please share the info with them.</description>

      <description>Alfred Thompson posted today about cheating on CS class projects. It was in response to Garth Flint&#39;s post on finding interesting projects which in turn referenced earlier posts by Alfred and me.
Garth laments that it&#39;s hard to find projects that are both interesting and meaty but where solutions can&#39;t easily be searched for online. Alfred notes that cheating will happen and that it&#39;s an ethics issue. This is why I try to create a culture of sharing and acknowledging credit (that is, citing sources) but I&#39;m not naive enough to believe there isn&#39;t any cheating in my classes.</description>

      <description>There are things we do in school and there are things we do in industry and they&#39;re not always the same. In school we might use a learning language or an IDE which gives additional support and at times even take away language features while at work you might you might make heavy use of continuous integration tools.
On the other hand, sometimes we use the same things. Java is used in schools and in industry, StackOverflow consulted in both and many schools use professional IDEs like Eclipse.</description>

We start with simplified rules:
 If the word starts with a vowel, add &#34;ay&#34; to the end of the word If it starts with a consonant move the first latter to the end and add &#34;</description>

They say they&#39;ll eventually have solutions but since the site appears to be at least a few years old, who knows it they&#39;ll ever publish them.
One interesting thing about the site is that it really doesn&#39;t have a lot of content to teach you the concepts around the challenges.</description>

She said &#34;whenever the superintendent or high level education people come and ask to see our best teachers I can never bring them to Jim&#39;s class.&#34; Everyone knows that Jim is the best. I describe him as &#34;the teacher I aspire to be.&#34; What&#39;s the problem? The problem is that Jim didn&#39;t teach the way the powers that be wanted him to teach.</description>

      <description>I spent this weekend diving back into Clojure or more specifically, Clojurescript. For those who don&#39;t know, Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. The solution it particularly seeks to &#34;solve&#34; is immutability. Clojurescript is Clojure that compiles to Javascript for web applications. Tooling aside, it&#39;s all pretty neat.
I didn&#39;t do anything earth shaking, just a quick implementation of Conway&#39;s game of life and Snake. While the code isn&#39;t particularly good, you can check them out here (Snake, Life).</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago there were some discussions about students working on and in larger projects. Most CS educators think it&#39;s a good idea to expose students to large projects even if we don&#39;t all agree as to what the best time is.
Regardless of when, figuring out a large project can be a bear and that&#39;s not just true for students. I saw this on my Tweetstream about onboarding software engineers:</description>

First stop, Niagara Falls.
  We did the Canada side 9 years ago when we did our Erie Canal bike trip (you can read about that by checking out some of my early blog posts). This time, the American side. My take is that the Canadian side is more polished and all private attractions - think Times Square or Disney.</description>

There&#39;s a teacher (name withheld to protect the innocent) who wants to create an advanced course for his students but his administration is requesting an outside measure of accountability. This sounds reasonable on the surface but I found it really insulting.</description>

In her most recent post Ria briefly talks about the fact that very few professional developers start from scratch and most work in existing large code bases. She wonders why the College Board got rid of the APCS-A case study and talked about how it gave students an opportunity to work on a multi-file complex system. Over the past few years others have wondered if the College Board should bring it back.</description>

I used to be a bit more hardcore having done a few sections of the Appalachian Trail in my youth. Now, as I&#39;ve gotten older I&#39;ve come to appreciate little things like air conditioning, showers, beds, and toilets. So, nowadays we usually try to get a cabin at a camp site.</description>

I didn&#39;t see any of the original threads but I&#39;m guessing they started with &#34;your startup needs them&#34; and then moved to the &#34;they can&#39;t work with anyone&#34; along with tons of fun tongue and cheek 1X engineer tweets.
It got me thinking about 10X students.</description>

Phoenix was beautiful even with it being unbearably hot at times and it&#39;s a place I think I&#39;d like to visit again when it&#39;s a bit cooler.
I said in an earlier post that for me, CSTA is typically more of a person conference and less of a session conference and that held true again.</description>

Since it&#39;s not unbearably hot outside - a cool and dry 80 in the shade - we&#39;re sitting outside. Devorah&#39;s knitting another square for Blanket Statement so I figured I&#39;d write a few words about what we&#39;ve been doing here in Phoenix leading up to our starting with our conference later today.</description>

      <description>Looking forward to flying out to Phoenix for CSTA-2019 Saturday morning. The conference doesn&#39;t officially start until Sunday, Monday for me since I&#39;m not doing any of the pre-conference workshops. We&#39;ll have most of Saturday as long as we&#39;re up to it, Sunday, and Monday morning. Actually, there is the GitHub reception on Sunday evening so that&#39;s kind of official conference stuff.
As to the conference, I&#39;m super looking forward to it.</description>

      <description>Garth Flint recently wrote another post talking about some of the PD going on in his neck of the woods. Garth talks about the disconnect between the professors putting on the PD and what goes on in the K12 classrooms of the attending teachers. Here&#39;s the money quote:
  “Why do all college CS profs think everyone loves math? Want to turn  kids off to programming? Throw math at them.</description>

      <description>Ok, probably more knitting but Crochet at CSTA was the line used in the newsletter and it sounds better.
As some of you know, my wife Devorah is all about the fiber arts. Knitting, spinning, dying, weaving, the works. We&#39;ve got a loom, two spinning wheels, two bobbin lace pillows, and bins and bins of deconstructed sheep, llamas, alpacas, and angora bunnies. I even got her some straw once to spin into gold.</description>

      <description>With ISTE ending, the next big event for CS treachers is the annual CSTA Conference. I first attended two years ago in Baltimore. Last year the conference, in Omaha was bigger and better in every way imaginable. I expect this year to be the best yet.
I don&#39;t go to a lot of conferences so I don&#39;t have much to compare CSTA with but I like the fact that it&#39;s is about half the size of SIGCSE.</description>

      <description>For those of you who don&#39;t know, MongoDB is a very popular NoSQL database. NoSQL is an overarching term describing databases that are not relational and don&#39;t implement Structured Query Language (SQL). In a relational database your data is stored in tables with columns - think spreadsheet where each row of the table is a record in the database. You link tables together via a common field or row name. NoSQL databases work differently.</description>

StuyHacks is a high school hackathon organized and run by students at Stuyvesant High School. Since it&#39;s run by students, the cast of organizers regularly changes.</description>

      <description>So, it turns out that there were 601 perfect scores on this years APCS-A exam. Over on Facebook a great question was raised - what does this mean and should we celebrate this?
What does it mean? There&#39;s no way to know. Maybe the number of perfect scores is just scaling up linearly with test takers. Maybe More kids are being exposed to CS prior to APCS-A and that&#39;s leading to more correct answers.</description>

      <description>With summer right around the corner I&#39;m hoping to spend at least a little time on some personal coding projects. There are a few work related tools I&#39;d love to develop and just some random areas of CS I&#39;d like to explore. If I finish them, the work projects will be web based.
I was thinking about using this as an opportunity to do a deeper dive into Clojure having used it for some experiments and competitions like Advent of Code but at the end of the day I decided not to.</description>

      <description>Now that the semester&#39;s over I&#39;ve had a chance to reflect a bit on my teaching over the past year.
This year I taught two classes each semester so the load was a little higher. First semester was one class of our CS0 and one of the lab/enrichment component that goes with CS1. Nothing big to report there as I&#39;ve done them both before.
The biggest difference was that I had to deal with two separate classes even though they&#39;re one cohort.</description>

      <description>Someone mentioned Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava in one of the CS educator Facbeook groups. It looked interesting so I thought I&#39;d give it a once over.
It&#39;s certainly an accessible book. Text mixed with cute line drawings, &#34;hand written&#34; text, diagrams and picture.s It reminded me of one of my favorite, most accessible Calculus books Who Was Fourier.
Overall I enjoyed the book but I&#39;m not sure what its best audience is.</description>

      <description>Reading Garth Flint&#39;s end of year post and Alfred Thompson&#39;s follow up had me thinking about a couple of things.
One was spurred when Garth wrote &#34;They also have to figure out the math before they code.&#34; This made me think about all the details we sometimes take for for granted. Things that are hard for our students that we just know. It&#39;s frequently math that we might find trivial but it could also be much simpler things.</description>

      <description>Just like last year, I&#39;m taking in two classes worth of students in to my honors program. The challenge is that I can only teach two classes and I&#39;ve got to figure out what to teach and then which students belong in which class.
It basically comes down to one of two courses, our CS0 (CSCI127) and our CS1 (CSCI135).
CSCI127 is a first programming experience. The normal class is taught as a large lecture with small recitation/labs.</description>

      <description>Just saw this:
Evaluation metric idea: take snapshots of students&amp;#39; grades each week (specifically, the grade they actually see in your LMS). How well do these correlate with your final assigned grade? Were students getting good estimates?
&amp;mdash; Austin Cory Bart (@AustinCorgiBart) May 18, 2019 
It made me think of a couple of conversations I had with more senior teachers early in my career.
They&#39;d tell me &#34;by and large, you know what the kids are going to get after a few week.</description>

A1: CSTA, Twitter chats like this one, @guzdial and @alfredtwo&amp;#39;s blogs among others. In all cases because those places start from assuming I&amp;#39;m a CS teacher, rather than starting from assuming I&amp;#39;m a teacher who is better at teaching something else. #csk8 https://t.co/6DO77fzq0j

      <description>Now that high school seniors have all committed to their respective colleges I though I&#39;d share some information on Hunter&#39;s incoming Daedalus (honors CS) cohort.
I joke about the first cohort saying that nobody applied to the program. That&#39;s kind of true. I jointed Hunter a little over three years ago in late January. That was after high school seniors had already applied to college and at that time the program didn&#39;t exist.</description>

      <description>I recently stumbled upon Laurie Barth on Twitter and noticed a couple of tweets about tech interviews and the hiring process, something I&#39;ve been thinking about recently.
Solid rant. I think the teach to the programming test market already exists. And it’s why interviewers who subscribe to these tactics get upset if a candidate admits they’ve seen the problem previously. Because it ruins the illusion that this is revealing how candidates think.</description>

Small, cheap, and independent - that is, not tied in to Amazon or Barnes and Nobles and I found myself doing a lot more recreational reading with it. I still preferred paper for technical books but for easy reading there was nothing like having tons of reading options always available.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s spring break and for me that&#39;s always been a good time to explore some new ideas.
Here&#39;s one that some of you might like, particularly if you&#39;re teaching APCS-A or something similar.
Many APCS-A teachers do a unit on image processing using the picture lab (alternate resource). Image processing is a nice platform to explore two dimensional arrays. You basically use a 2D array of pixels (points) to represent an image.</description>

Well, I did the lesson(s) again this past week and it looks like it&#39;s a keeper. The setup was pretty much the same with some hiccups due to using a new platform. Last semester I used plain GitHub public repos. This time, I&#39;ve been using GitHub classroom which I like very much but I forgot that I made this assignment use private repos which turned out to be a hassle.</description>

Even better is the fact that we&#39;re gaining a couple of new teachers at each session.
Last time, we were at Digital Ocean, a cloud provide that has been very involved in education since their creation and has been a tremendous boon to my education projects over the years.</description>

One of the requirements is that we have 12 graduate CS credits in our program and that in those courses these five major areas:
 Algorithms and programming Computing systems Data and analysis Impacts of computing Networks and the internet  as described in the K12 CS Framework. Even though many of the items described in the framework fit better in an education side course NY is requiring that it&#39;s all covered in CS courses offered by a CS department.</description>

Why so busy? It&#39;s the same old story - you&#39;ve got all those projects that you&#39;re waiting on and everything comes in at the same time.
To start off, it&#39;s college decision season. The high school seniors all know their options and are deciding where to go.</description>

My old one was a 27&#34; Hanns G. Actually, the old ones - my old set up was 2 of them side by side. When I started at Hunter, I was given a piddly small monitor so I tried to buy my own 27&#34; Hanns G to bring in but they were no longer available. The 27&#34; jobs available then were much more expensive so my work monitor situation has been sadly lacking.</description>

      <description>Since Hunter uses C++ as it&#39;s core language, I haven&#39;t used Java much in the past three years. That&#39;s going to change pretty soon. Once we start offering our CS teacher Certificate and Masters programs I&#39;ll once again start teaching with Java as that&#39;s one of the langauges that we want to prepare our teachers with.
That means deciding on a set of tools and so I&#39;ve been spending time evaluating Java programming environments with an eye on the beginner since not only do the teachers I work with have to be comfortable with the tool but more importantly they will have to be able to support the tool for all of their students.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s that time of the year to write a series of blog posts about SIGCSE. I thought I&#39;d start with one on the keynotes.
There were four keynote speakers. Marie desJardins, Gloria Townsend, Mark Guzdial, and Blair Taylor. I wasn&#39;t at the first timer&#39;s lunch where Townsend spoke so I won&#39;t talk at all about that keynote.
I&#39;m also not going to summarize the talks. Andy Ko wrote up a terrific summary of his SIGCSE experience and did a much better job giving overviews to the keynotes than I ever could so I&#39;ll just refer you to Andy&#39;s blog post.</description>

      <description>Back in December we ran our first PD session for CS teachers. This was to address the need for professional development for teachers who were more experienced in terms of computer science - we aimed this at people who were ready to teach APCS-A, similar, or beyond and also to start to build a community for these teachers.
We had trouble setting things up for February but we&#39;re good to go for March, April and May.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s great to see how much Hunter CS has developed since starting here there years ago. The latest endeavor is Winter Codefest. During the fall I was approached by one of my students who had asked an older Hunter CS student about their portfolio and found that the senior&#39;s portfolio was lacking. This student said we should do something to help encourage younger students to build that portfolio.
The result was Winter Codefest.</description>

      <description>There was some buzz over this editorial about the College Board last week. The two codes every child needs - Coding and the US Constitution? Who could argue with that.
I&#39;m not going to disagree. Civics and CS are important and can&#39;t wait until college. The thing that left me chilled though was that nobody&#39;s paying attention to the fact that the College Board - a private entity with its own interests has so much influence over American education.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been an amazingly unproductive weekend. Mostly because I&#39;ve been sick with the flu. It sucks but since the rest of the family&#39;s away anway at least I&#39;m not making everyone miserable.
I did manage to stage my next couple of classes and figured that writing this post wouldn&#39;t take too much energy since it&#39;s mostly a video.
Earlier, I talked about using GitHub and TravicCI and this time around I show how I use GitHub classroom to set up, disseminate, and collect assignments.</description>

      <description>I was planning on either following up on how I use GitHub classroom or commenting on the recent NY Times opinion piece on the College Board but the follow up, fall out, and polarization from the Amazon NY thing has been stuck in my head so I thought I&#39;d write a bit more about it.
Like my previous post, this isn&#39;t really about Amazon but rather about the long game, equity, and diversity and how a lot of people are fooling themselves.</description>

      <description>That was the big tech news today. I know there was a good deal of vocal outrage about the deal but to be honest I was pretty surprised by the news. Normally deals like these get steamrolled through for better or worse.
I have decidedly mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I have no problem with Amazon - I&#39;ve got a bunch of former students working there. Mostly in Seattle but at least one in NYC.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I was reminded why I love GitHub in support of my classes. One of my students posted a question about our current lab. They posted a synopsis of the problem along with the error message.
Since we&#39;re all working on GitHub the student&#39;s work was already up online Since I started using GitHub Classroom I was able to quickly navigate to the repo. This might have been enough but to really in to the students work I cloned the repo and went into Emacs.</description>

To me a Drag and Drop language can certainly be a real language and many are. I also think they&#39;re terrific when used correctly. I just think they&#39;re frequently misapplied in later grades.

      <description>Two of the hardest topics to make meaningful to students in APCS-A are inheritance and interfaces. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re super difficult topics but rather that they&#39;re not often needed, useful, or superior to not using them on beginner assignments. More often than not the motivation is a bit forced as are the assignments.
Inheritance is its own can of worms and to be honest, something I&#39;ve not found to be all that useful or necessary.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon a thread over in the APCS-A Facebook group the other day. It seems that the College Board is making some changes in their registration timeline. In the past, students registered for the exam sometime in March with the exams administered in May. The new changes include requiring registration in November along with $40 late registration and cancellation fees.
The College Board is, of course, spinning this as for the student&#39;s benefit.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using GitHub with my classes since GitHub&#39;s early days. Over time I&#39;ve gotten my workflows down. I use a combination of shell scripts - many just written on the fly, GitHub organizations, and some naming conventions and protocols that have served me well.
A few years ago, the GitHub Education team started GitHub Classroom. I looked at it at the time. It was pretty cool but I had my workflow so I didn&#39;t adopt it.</description>

      <description>One of the great things about Emacs is that it&#39;s not just for writing programs. Sure, you can set it up as an IDE for just about every programming language under the sun but that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. I use Emacs for just about all my text processing. This includes writing blog posts, reading and writing emails, creating lesson plans and pretty much anything and everything having to do with text.</description>

      <description>Monday&#39;s the start of the Spring semester. Other than the 8:00am start I&#39;m looking forward to it. My 8:00am class is the honors/lab component that goes with CS1. I taught it last semester and during each of the past two years at Hunter. My second class is the follow up - more OOP / C++, data structures and some algorithms.
The material is old hat. I&#39;ve taught it in Java more times than I can count and also in C++ albeit many years ago.</description>

Here&#39;s a quick video showing how to set up irony-mode which uses libclang for completions. It&#39;s pretty slick. Now the only thing I think I&#39;m missing is header file completions.</description>

      <description>So many programming assignments involve a direct solution. Write a program to do this or write a problem to solve that. It&#39;s pretty typical. There&#39;s nothing wrong with assignments like these. They allow students to practice what they&#39;ve been learning and it gives them the opportunity to create some cool programs. All the same, I like it when there&#39;s an indirect problem. You&#39;re faced with a problem but in order to solve it you first have to solve some other problem</description>

In the first half, Mark talked about other types of &#34;thinking.&#34; Scientific thinking, engineering thinking and even historical thinking. All had a good amount of overlap with both each other and with computational thinking even as we haven&#39;t yet settled on what computational thinking actually is.</description>

As part of my job at Hunter, I read and evaluate some of the Macaulay Honors College applications. I also have to evaluate all the applicants to my CS honors program.

The theme was Computational Thinking and the day consisted of a variety of talks, panels, and activities. I plan on writing about one panel in particular but for today I wanted to address something that came up as a question. One attendee asked a panel about the achievement gap - the fact that when the CS movement got started in NY some of the more innovative and interesting work was being done with some of our most vulnerable students.</description>

Organizations and companies with curricula to sell package it all up ahead of time lesson by lesson unit by unit. When I create a new course at Hunter, they demand a sample syllabus during the approval process with a week by week outline, assignments reading and more.</description>

      <description>I spent a couple of days last week hunkered down working designing a CS Ethics course and of course it got me thinking about designing courses in general.
One of the topics I&#39;ve ranted on is my disdain for canned curricula. I&#39;ve never been a fan. This isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t want to leverage other people&#39;s work. I&#39;ll take sample curricula, lessons, and all the resources I can get my hands on but I&#39;d never just deliver them as is.</description>

Even though the original motivation for the visits was to get the word out about Hunter CS and the awesome things we&#39;re doing in the Hunter CS Honors program I always tried to make my talks about something that would be relevant for the entire audience and not just the few that were great fits for my program.</description>

The idea started as a joke but morphed into a legit idea.
I was talking to some friends about CTLE hours and how ridiculous the system is. NY State teachers need 100 hours of CTLE credit (PD hours) every so many years.</description>

      <description>A question that frequently comes up with respect to CS for All is what does it mean?
To me it means giving all students some fundamental exposure to computer science so that they can:
 Make use of those thinking skills, problem solving approaches, and practical tools regardless of their future paths. Provide a path for the subset of &#34;all&#34; that desire to further pursue computer science.  But even with this, how do you do it?</description>

Maybe: -1% to your course grade multiplied by the edit distance of the word with its correction?

      <description>Thanksgiving weekend is also reunion weekend. I&#39;ve been on and off invited to Stuy reunions over the years. Not as often it seems as some teachers but more often than others. I always do my best to attend. I have very fond memories of many students and many classes over many years and think a lot about them so feel very honored whenever I&#39;m invited to one of these.
In the past each class due a reunion did its own thing - some club or bar usually in Manhattan.</description>

      <title>Teaching Sorting</title>

      <description>Earlier today I saw a facebook post asking for thoughts on teaching sorting. The question was specifically not about motivations like having the class act out sorts or sort cards but rather about the coding.
I&#39;ve been meaning to write about this since last summer when I attended Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk on the same subject.
Early in my career when teaching sorting I developed the n^2 sorts as standalone routines just as they&#39;re presented in most books but as I gained more experience as a teacher, I changed it up to build the sorts (at least some of them) from existing concepts.</description>

      <description>I spent this past Saturday morning up at the Microsoft building in Times Square. What was I doing there? Aankit Patel invited me to check out the professional development that he and his team organized for the teachers involved in the assorted CSforAllNYC programs that his office runs.
Wow.
Lots of great things going on. I was only able to stay for a couple of hours but I spent some time in two rooms run by TEALS, a room of BJC teachers, a group working with p5.</description>

      <description>Sometimes professional practices don&#39;t work well in the classroom and sometimes they do. One professional practice that does work well is code review - reading and reflecting on other peoples code.
I&#39;ve had my students do code reviews in the past but this time I did things differently. Here&#39;s what I did and here&#39;s how it went
Two weeks ago my students completed a lab. The lab involved reading in a poorly indented C++ program and spit out a properly indented one.</description>

      <description>Mark Guzdial&#39;s post the other day about direct isntruction struck a chord with me. Right up front, Mark said:
  The research evidence is growing that students learn better through direct instruction rather than through a discovery-based method, where we expect students to figure things out for themselves.  Quite a surprise to the teachers who have been beaten over the head with &#34;everything must be discovery&#34; in recent years.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I took twenty four of my first year students up to Catskills Conf. As usual it was a great weekend. I particularly enjoyed this years talks.
I found one talk particularly engaging. Jordan Koschei gave at talk titled Digital Terroir. Terroir refers to the natural envorinment in which a wine is produced - the ground, the climate, everything. It&#39;s why wine (and foods) produced in one location taste differently than the same things mamde elsewhere.</description>

      <description>I use both org-mode and Google Calendar for scheduling. I like Google Calendar because: It&#39;s pretty universal so I can issue and accept calendar invites. It works well with my phone and other mobile devices. The rest of my family doesn&#39;t live in Emacs :-(.   I prefer using org-mode beacuse: Emacs I prefer, for the most part, to control my data.  I partially sync the two platforms.</description>

      <description>I was originally going to do a video on how I set things up so that I get an email every morning with my org-mode agenda but that&#39;s going to be something of an ordeal. I have to create a droploet on Digital Ocean, set up SyncThing and a mail server and lots of other things.
I&#39;ll get to that video at some point but in the meantime I saw this thread on the Emacs subreddit.</description>

      <description>Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to Catskills Conf, an annual event that I describe as &#34;light tech conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&#34; I&#39;ve written about the event before if anyone&#39;s interested in more details. As in past years, Devorah ran her knitting for good project. In each of the first two years of the project, attendees of Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted and assembled a blanket for Project Linux which provides hand made blankets to children in crisis.</description>

      <description>I just read this post by Bethany Crystal - Going off script.
Bethany writes that while she normally essentially scripts important presentations, this time she went more off the cuff.
It made me think about how I teach and a disturbing trend I&#39;ve seen in CS education and education in general.
I&#39;ve never strictly used a script for teaching. When I started I did use very detailed lesson plans. Back then I was teaching math.</description>

      <description>I can&#39;t believe that I haven&#39;t made a video since the beginning of summer!!!
Part of the reason is that I haven&#39;t had any video ideas that have motivated me and the other reason is that the Fall is my busiest season.
In any event, here&#39;s the latest installment.
Take a look at how I use Emacs and more specifically org-mode for my day to day work. Sometimes I use the fancy power tools but to be honest, most of the time, I stick to the basics.</description>

      <description>Parts 1 and 3  Part 1 Part 3  Part 2 When we left off last time we used a search engine API to gather a whole bunch of documents with the term &#34;played Spiderman&#34; or &#34;who played Spiderman.&#34; Now we have to process these documents to answer the question. Fortunately, the documents are basically just big strings of text.
Since we&#39;re doing a &#34;who&#34; query we want to find all the names in all the documents.</description>

Beforehand though, we had to talk about classes. One of my students asked if probability and/or statistics were really important for CS. I started to cite a few examples and then decided to segue into this.</description>

  Student: Teacher, I need help  Teacher (comes over)  Student (shows screen listing three bazillion errors)  The student has just written pages of code and finally decided to try to run it only to end up with pages of errors.
Error messages can at times be hard to read for beginners but to see and truth be told, they frequently don&#39;t even read them but over the years I&#39;ve developed a practice that I&#39;ve found helpful as a software developer and if students adopt the same practice it can save them a lot of time and effort.</description>

      <title>Challenges of teaching at a commuter school</title>

      <description>One of the bigger challenges faced at commuter schools is building a feeling of community. Students aren&#39;t on campus every day and come from far afield and even when they are on campus, we really don&#39;t have a CS &#34;hang out&#34; space. The space issue should be resolved soon - we&#39;re scheduled to get a CS student lounge next semester.
I&#39;m finding this to be even more of a challenge this year with my honors students.</description>

      <description>Never use global variables Never break out of a loop  These are two &#34;best practices&#34; that are frequently touted in early CS classes both at the high school and college level.
They came up a couple of times yesterday. Once in the Facebook APCS-A teachers group and once on Alfred Thompson&#39;s blog.
Alfred post was topically on global variables. Actually it was deeper than just global variables. It&#39;s also about how students progress - what they can figure out at various stages of progress and how what seems like a good idea early on the path to computer science doesn&#39;t seem so great later on.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve heard it many times with computer science - &#34;the kids know more than the teacher.&#34;
On the one hand, the truth is that this isn&#39;t so much the case. Kids might use computers all the time but they don&#39;t necessarily know much about them or about computer science (link 1, link 2). Then you have students who think they know all about CS but really don&#39;t. They might have picked up a bit of coding somewhere but more often than not, the knowledge is pretty superficial.</description>

The program and Hunter CS as a whole have made a lot of progress over the past two years and each year I roll out new special activities and events for my honors students.</description>

 Some of the questions and concerns that I&#39;ve seen recently include: What is CT?? Will rich schools get CS and poor only CT? Will rich schools get CS and poor on coding?  The first question is a big one and as a community we haven&#39;t answered it yet.</description>

      <description>If you check out Twitter, Facebook, Medium and other blog sites you might get the idea that you&#39;re the worst teacher in the world. The internet abounds with people sharing tweets and posts about wonderful lessons they&#39;ve just taught, witnessed or learned about in professional development. Sure, the teacher forums rife with requests for lesson ideas and resources but the shared material is always aces.
It makes sense, people in the community want to share things that worked for them or things they think will work.</description>

      <description>The new site is live. I&#39;m now running a Hugo based blog. I set it up using the Mainroad theme which seems to support everything I want.
Out of the box Hugo supports org-mode with pretty much all of its niceties like:
 code highlighting org-mode structure (lists, tables) html can be directly embedded tags and categories  The Mainroad theme added:
 MathJax Analytics An easy menu widgets for the sidebar  It was pretty easy to customize and deploying to GitHub pages is pretty simple.</description>

I&#39;m a professsor at Hunter College working on two major projects. One is to create and run a program to certify middle and high school computer science teachers.
We&#39;re also creating a new CS undergraduate honors program and I&#39;m the mentor. We&#39;re going to be one of the few CS programs that in addition to giving our students all the CS background and theory, will connect students to current industry practices and opportunities.</description>

      <description>It was Jon and Amy&#39;s wedding. Jon was my student back in the day so there were a handful of Stuy alums there to celebrate the occasion. Some, like Jon, I had stayed in touch with and now count as friends. Others, I knew but hadn&#39;t kept up with.
I was with a cluster of guests and for some reason the conversation turned to chess computers. I started telling a story about the my former teacher Herb Greenhut&#39;s Talking Chess Challenger computer.</description>

      <description>Do we really need CS focused high schools?
That&#39;s the question Alfred Thompson asked partly in reaction to my post talking about Bill Gates&#39; visit to AFSE, a NYC public school with a CS focus.
On both posts, Michael Preston shared some important and good points about AFSE as a starting point and gateway that helped lead to CS4All in NYC and also specifically about AFSE.
In response to Alfred&#39;s question I thought it was time I shared a bit about what I was pushing for AFSE back when I was involved.</description>

      <description>AFSE stands for the Academy for Software Engineering. It&#39;s a public school in New York City with a stated focus on, well, software engineering. I have some history with the school and its creation but that&#39;s not what this post is about. In fact, this post isn&#39;t really about AFSE at all. I plan to neither praise or critique the school. This is about what Bill Gates wrote about his recent visit.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Alfred Thompson asked &#34;Why is it important for CS students to understand binary?&#34; on Twitter which led to a number of interesting responses. Alfred summarized and wrote his own thoughts on his blog.
I wanted to add a comment but I already wrote a post for yesterday so put it off until today.
First let me say that you can have a very successful career in tech and not really know binary or number bases other than 10.</description>

      <description>Today was the first day of school for all NYC teachers. Students come back tomorrow. That&#39;s a quick turnaround. Some years, they get a day or two before the kids come in. That&#39;s much easier.
The first day is usually dominated by meetings. In a large school like Stuy you&#39;ll typically have a long faculty meeting in the morning and a department meeting in the afternoon. Not much time to actually get ready for classes.</description>

      <description>Classes started up again today so I thought I&#39;d talk about my class rules.
I don&#39;t seem to recall many class rules in college. Sure, there was a grading policy governing homework and the like but not much beyond that. In K12 there are usually more. When you can talk, how you set up your notebook, how to do homework, bathroom policy etc.
For years, I&#39;ve used the same set of class rules and I always talk about the rules with my classes.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I was asked about my avatar:
I&#39;ve been using it for most services for a few months now. It&#39;s an image that I&#39;ve had for ages. I started thinking about using it about a year ago
So, what&#39;s the story?
It was back in 1993. I had just started at Stuy. I taught some CS when I was at Seward Park but at the time, I was teaching all math at Stuy.</description>

      <description>Writing about old projects got me thinking of my first programming gig and software longevity. It was a part time after school / full time summer job at Arcus-Simplex-Brown. I started in my senior year in high school and continued through most of my first year in college. It wasn&#39;t my first job - that was being a delivery boy at Video Room, an independent video store that&#39;s survived from the old VHS/Betamax days through DVDs and is still, somehow or other, surviving in this day and age of streaming video.</description>

      <description>JCS&#39;s post on Irreal today brought me back. It was about Brief which was the editing hotness back in the day. I played with it a little really mostly used Emacs clones for real work when I was stuck on MS-DOS systems. Usually either JOVE or Epsilon
In the comments Jon reminded me about the MKS Toolkit which brought most everyday Unix tools to DOS along with a shell and a version of Vi.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been following the tweets coming out of ICER2018. I&#39;ve never been to ICER but now am thinking about trying to get funding to go next year. One set of tweets involved students writing or using APIs or Libraries. This overlaps with Owen Astrachan&#39;s talk from this past year&#39;s CSTA conference on sorting. I was planning on writing a post about Owen&#39;s talk but I thought I&#39;d leave it for the school year closer to when sorting is typically covered.</description>

      <description>Right now I&#39;m on vacation in Harrogate England. Natan is here taking part in the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival so Devorah and I came along as tourists. Today we went to Knaresborough:
Normally when traveling I try to get everything in and that leaves me pretty exhausted at the end of each day. Since this time we&#39;ll be here for around two weeks, I&#39;m trying a less hectic pace. Do some touring along with some rest and relaxation.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s August 3rd and I&#39;ve been giving a lot of thought to the start of the semester. Normally I wouldn&#39;t think about the Fall term this early. While I&#39;ve been working on and off since last semester ended, I don&#39;t officially &#34;go back&#34; until August 23rd with classes starting on the 27th. The difference is that for the first time in forever we&#39;re taking a longish trip between now and then.</description>

      <description>If one looks at my twitter feed they&#39;ll notice that in addition to CS Ed, another issue I&#39;m passionate about is school reform or rather resistance to what is popularly known as and mislabeled as school reform. I&#39;m anti vouchers, charter schools, high stakes testing and more. One of the heroes of this resistance is education historian Diane Ravitch. I&#39;m a big fan of Diane&#39;s and she&#39;s one of the true great champions of public schools, kids, and teachers.</description>

      <description>My friend Adam posted this link to an article on the new digital divide the other day. It&#39;s talking about young people who do everything on the phone so aren&#39;t familiar or comfortable with a traditional keyboard/mouse computer setup. In the comments there were some of us who lamented about the term &#34;digital natives&#34; and the idea that kids these days know all about computers and technology.
This led me to think about a couple of things.</description>

      <description>I think it&#39;s time for me to start developing a CS Ethics class.
An ethics course isn&#39;t a replacement for having teachers that live and model good behavior and weave ethical issues throughout the curriculum but still, adding a separate course on top of that has its merits.
I&#39;m not in a rush to create this course. I might be done in a month or it might take a couple of years.</description>

      <description>I noticed a couple of short videos - interviews with Brian Kernighan - on my YouTube home page the other day. This is probably because I recently viewed a Kernighan video in the same series after reading this post on the history of naming grep on JCS&#39;s blog.
 For you youngsters out there, CS people of my generation relied on Brian&#39;s books &#34;The C Programming Language&#34; and &#34;The Unix Programming Environment&#34;</description>

      <description>In what grade should students take APCS? This question comes up from time to time.
I&#39;ve heard answers ranging from middle school through never. Infact, years ago, my chairman relayed a conversation he had with Marvin Minsky where he asked Minsky what the high schools should be teaching with respect to CS. The answer was &#34;nothing.&#34; This was then amended to &#34;teach them to type.&#34; Of course this was a long time ago but I believe the sentiment was that college was the right time and the high schools don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing and will just screw up the kids.</description>

      <description>In addition to everything I wrote about last time there were a couple of other big announcements at this year&#39;s CSTA conference. Both announcements deal with funding.
First, there is a new class of CSTA membership. The free tier remains but now for $50 you can join CSTA+. This new level of membership comes with a bunch of extras that are probably good for K12 teachers but I doubt I&#39;ll use any of them.</description>

      <description>I just got back from the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher&#39;s Association) conference. It&#39;s the biggest annual conference dedicated to K12 CS education. I think there were about 700 people attending. It felt much larger than last year but compared to SIGCSE which is double the size, CSTA still felt pretty intimate.
The conference was in Omaha Devorah came along to play tourist and we both came a day early to do some site seeing.</description>

I&#39;m no longer teaching high school but still fancy myself a teacher first and part of the K12CS community. We&#39;re a growing community and we&#39;re growing fast.
Usually, at this time of year we see a number of people posting their results. &#34;I had 16 test takers, had 5 fives, 6 fours etc.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve taken part in a few conversations and read more than a few threads on teacher certification exams recently. Specifically, CS teacher certification exams. There are a bunch of them floating around. There&#39;s the Praxis offered by ETS, the one from the National Evaluation Series, the Washington Evaluator Test Series one and then there&#39;s what&#39;s going on in Texas. NY State says it will eventually develop their own.
I have mixed feelings about exams like these.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my last post, this coming weekend is the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) conference. I&#39;ve been a member of CSTA since the beginning but this will be only the second time I&#39;ve made it to the annual conference.
The CSTA conference might be the largest conference specifically for k12 computer science teachers and that makes it different from conferences like SIGCSE which is for CS education and education research at all levels or ISTE which seems to be more of an Ed Tech conference.</description>

It&#39;s probably the biggest conference focussed on K12 Computer Science education. This year, in addition to attending, I&#39;ll be giving a talk on preservice and inservice CS teacher preparation programs. I&#39;ll be talking about the new New York State certification requirements along with what we&#39;re rolling out at Hunter College.
This means putting together a slide deck for the session.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was back on campus for an early orientation session for Hunter&#39;s incoming Daedalus CS honors students. It was the first time all of us got to meet face to face. The students I met with will be my third cohort. I got to thinking how far we&#39;ve come in under three years.
Hunter&#39;s had a strong but little known undergraduate CS program for as long as I&#39;ve known. Much like any program, we&#39;ve got our strengths and weaknesses but you go through our program and academically you&#39;ll be as well prepared as from anywhere else.</description>

I was going to get back to CS and CS Ed related blogging today but there&#39;s more to the story.
In spite of what BdB stated, it&#39;s not enough for him to switch to another measure - the middle school state exam along with some modifiers.</description>

We started kids using scheme on 10th grade at stuy so did recursion early. Not everyone got all of it but it think it made things much easier for those that you more CS later.

We introduced recursion very early in our intro course at Stuy and I think it worked well.</description>

      <description>Last time I mentioned the pushback on CS for All. While many people are all in for CS for All, resistance is coming from many areas. There&#39;s resistance from teachers of other subject areas, people who think it&#39;s merely job training for the tech industry (which it can be if done poorly), people who feel it will be implemented at the expense of other important subjects already on the chopping block like music and art, and others.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s been a lively discussion on pushback to CS for All at the K12 level over on Facebook. Mark Guzdial started a sub thread asking if CS for All should first be implemented at the undergrad level rather than K12.
It&#39;s an interesting question and as good as anything to get me out of my month long non-blogging rut.
Mark was right when he said that if Colleges implement CS for All, K12 will likely do so to follow - just look at AP.</description>

      <description>A fear revolving around CS For All concerns where will the money come from and how will we fit in the new classes.
One suggested solution is to integrate CS into other subjects. I thought I&#39;d write today about why I don&#39;t think the fear is valid and while integrating CS into other classes can have value, it probably isn&#39;t a long term solution for CS education.
Let&#39;s start with the integration solution.</description>

      <description>This morning, Mark Guzdial wrote about unfunded mandates and CS for All. Unfunded mandates frequently wreak havoc on schools in a number of ways but in the long run, I don&#39;t think it should have a severe effect on CS for All. Rather, it could have a big impact on the number of CS courses we offer beyond that.
Mark relay&#39;s a story from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School where at the time many students wanted more CS classes but the school wasn&#39;t planning on hiring a new CS teacher.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&#39;ve heard for years from former students - both those looking for jobs and those looking to hire is that colleges don&#39;t really do a good job preparing students for careers in tech. Sure they teach the algorithms and the theory but ther are a lot of missing pieces, particularly on the practical end. I&#39;m certainly not advocating turning CS programs into coding schools but there are many low cost opportunities to bring practical real world best practices in to the CS classroom.</description>

      <description>I tweeted this the other day:
Why don&amp;#39;t so many teachers and professors understand that the test or assignment you can do in 15 minutes will take your beginning students at least an hour and probably a lot more to complete.
&amp;mdash; Mike Zamansky (@zamansky) April 18, 2018 
What led to the tweet was a discussion I was having with some students about not having enough time on tests which led to a discussion of having to drop everything to spend every waking hour on a project.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I wrote about on my lab grading workflow. In the post I mentioned that I used Emacs to easily navigate between student folders and files so I can actually look at their work in addition to their programs output and test results.
The key is a combination of dired and ag, Emacs&#39;s interface to the Silver Searcher which is something like a recursive code grep on steroids.</description>

      <description>The most recent NYC CSTA chapter meeting was &#34;How do I assess CS?&#34; I wanted to go but it&#39;s been such a crazy month I was just too wiped out. Fortunately, the meetup was recorded. I was able to watch the first half this morning while working out on my stationary trainer which leads me to today&#39;s rare Saturday morning blog post. The meetup consisted of two panels. The first was made up of K12 teachers who taught CS.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve talked before about unit testing (here, and here). My premise is that in addition to being an important industry technique, it&#39;s a sound practice for students studying CS. I also contend that it can make grading easier on the teacher. Maybe not as easy as an auto-grader but those have their own problems.
Since I spent most of today grading I thought I&#39;d share my current workflow and how unit tests have made me more efficient.</description>

I&#39;ve been known to be &#34;prickly,&#34; which is a nice way of putting it and I&#39;m openly critical of many programs out there.
One program, however, that I very much like is TEALS. They&#39;ve been around since 2009 founded by Kevin Wang, a former teacher. The basic idea was to have tech professionals go to a school on the way to work and team teach a CS class with one of the school&#39;s teachers.</description>

I agree with a number of the challenges in creating CS teacher preparation programs that were outlined in the report and I also agree with the idea that a strong CS teacher preparation program should prepare teachers to teach any (and in the case of the programs I designed, create new) curriculum but I wanted to focus on one specific item that was brought up last Thursday.</description>

      <description>About a week ago New York State&#39;s new regulation creating a K12 CS teacher certification went live. Just the other day I was honored to be interviewed by Matt Flamm of Crain&#39;s New York in a follow up piece about it.
Having K12 CS teacher certification is big and having quality programs that lead to certification is HUGE. In my view, it&#39;s a game changer.

What changed? Along with the new version of Magin, Jonas Bernoulli wrote up a walkthrough of the Magit interface. For whatever reason, it all finally clicked.
In spite of what the documentation says, Magit is not an interface for git.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s the last day of spring break. After the weekend it&#39;s back to the grind. It really hasn&#39;t been much of a spring break. The rain and the snow made for very little spring and between working on the Hunter / CUNY2X Internship program and reviewing applications for my Hunter Daedalus CS Honors program there has been very little break.
Today was no exception - I spent much of the day working but I did take a few hours to head over to Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island.</description>

I do my best to keep up with the latest and greatest in the CS world both on the academic side as well as the professional one. That&#39;s not really possible, but I do my best. When I have a small project to work on I&#39;ll some times use it as an excuse to play with some recent technology.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s so much to like in the shape drawing lessons I talked about in my refactoring post that I thought I&#39;d share a little more here.
It can be argued that the most important things for a program to do is work. The most clever, elegant, creative program is worthless if it doesn&#39;t produce the desired result. All too often, beginners and hot shot beginners in particular try to be too clever too early and get themselves into trouble.</description>

My reaction to MacCormick was - &#34;This is awesome but while he&#39;s talking about redesigning existing theory courses, I think we can get a lot of mileage out of bringing these ideas into lower level CS courses.</description>

      <description>One of my laments on teaching computer science is that students are rarely taught and given the chance to develop good programming practices. There&#39;s usually not enough time. Beginners work on small &#34;toys&#34; which don&#39;t lend themselves to good software development practices and later on, there&#39;s so much other material like algorithms, data structures etc. to teach and learn that programming practices usually amount to lines like:

My class interleaves with Hunter&#39;s CSCI 13500 - Software Analysis and Design I class. One day each week, my students have complete a hands on lab focusing on whatever is being covered in the 13500 class. I decided to use one of those labs as a first foray into testing.</description>

Over on his blog, Alfred Thompson noted that the winners were either from independent or magnet public schools. Alfred also noted that most of the winners of prestigious science competitions like the Regeneron Science Talent Search (nee Intel, nee Westinghouse) were from public magnet schools. In his post, Alfred ruminates on this and wonders &#34;how to we add the flexibility and support to more students at more schools?</description>

It looks like it&#39;s going to be a great way to solve a particular problem that come up now and again.
There are plenty of times when I want to create a number of similar but slightly different blocks of text. The example on the project site is:
count_of_red = get_total(&amp;#34;red&amp;#34;); count_of_blue = get_total(&amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;); count_of_green = get_total(&amp;#34;green&amp;#34;);  You could use multiple cursors, a macro, or other methods to put in the common text but you still have to deal with the parts of each line that are unique, the red, green, and blue.</description>

MacCormicks&#39;s stance is that CS theory is tough the first time around and using non-decision problems is a viable approach to make theory more accessible to beginners. As MacCormick said in his paper:
  ... a decision problem may ask the yes/no question, &#34;Does this graph  have a Hamilton cycle?</description>

While there are education researchers that I very much respect, overall, I&#39;m skeptical of education research. Note that I&#39;m not talking specifically about CS Ed research but rather education research in general.

      <title>Using Emacs 43 - Music with MPD</title>

      <description>I like to listen to music at work. Sometimes I just stream from YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify or some other online source but if you&#39;re a person of a certain age, like me, you probably have quite an mp3 collection. All those CDs that have been ripped not to mention some converted vinyl.
I used to use the Music Player Daemon or MPD back in the day. It would run in the background and you could connect to it using lots of clients.</description>

      <description>With CS4All being the buzzword of the day we&#39;re paying a lot of attention to the fact that when we teach a CS class for all students, most of them won&#39;t end up studying CS or going directly into a tech heavy field.
Among those that do study CS though, there is another division. Those studying CS as an academic exercise or to go on to graduate studies and those who are going in to the tech sector.</description>

      <description>One day I&#39;ll do a Magit video but since there are already some good ones out there I thought I&#39;d share a couple of other great git related packages.
The first is Git Gutter which adds markers on the side gutter of your buffer so you know what&#39;s changed since you&#39;re last commit. I pretty much use it exclusively for that visual but it can also be used to cmmit and revert individual chunks of your changes.</description>

      <description>Another Emacs quick hit today. Actually, not really Emacs. Today&#39;s video is a quick, really quick, look at Pandoc. Pandoc is a document converter.
Here are the formats that Pandoc can covert read from:
  Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored Markdown,  MultiMarkdown, and (subsets of) Textile, reStructuredText, HTML,  LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0,  Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org mode, DocBook, JATS, Muse, txt2tags,  Vimwiki, EPUB, ODT, and Word docx.</description>

      <description>I make regular use of Google&#39;s office suite. I use Google forms all the time to collect data, Google docs when I have to leave Emacs for document preparation - usually when I have to collaborate with others online and I use Google Sheets as my greadebook.
I don&#39;t do a lot of data processing using Google sheets. For that I download the data and write small scripts. On the other hand it turns out that you can do some pretty nifty things by scripting right in Google sheets.</description>

      <description>Thanks to everyone who voted for topics or commented with suggestions for videos. I&#39;ll try to get to them in the coming months.
Today is just a quick hit on Atomic Chrome - an Emacs package and browser extension that allows you to edit web form inputs with Emacs.
UPDATE I forgot to mention that you can set a shortcut key, at least in chrome rather than clicking on the icon.</description>

      <description>I thought I&#39;d answer Alfred Thompson&#39;s recent post on using textbooks. Like Alfred, I&#39;ve never used textbooks particularly effectively. Even when I taught math I mostly used them as a resource for problems.
I also agree with Alfred in questioning the &#34;flipped class&#34; model or as I like to call it &#34;homework&#34; for reasons similar to Alfred&#39;s.
Even back in the Pascal days of APCS getting textbooks was an ordeal in NYC.</description>

      <description>Last week, Mark Guzdial asked What does it mean for Computer Science to be harder to learn than other STEM subjects? as a follow up to his ACM Blog post this month and the ensuing discussion.
You should read both posts but here&#39;s how Mark started off the follow up:
  I made an argument in my Blog@CACM Post for this month that “Learning  Computer Science is Different than Learning Other STEM Disciplines,”  and on Twitter, I explicitly added “It’s harder.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been on both sides of the recommendation game. I currently read all the recommendations for students who apply to my honors CS program at Hunter and some of the ones written for the Macaulay Honors program. I also read some for the CSTUY summer program. On the other side, I&#39;ve written hundreds if not thousands of recs for seniors when I was teaching at Stuy.
I&#39;ve been meaning to write about recs and when I saw yesterday&#39;s post on AVC.</description>

      <description>Advanced Placement Computer Science got top billing on Alfred Thompson&#39;s Things I&#39;m Watching in 2017 post. Alfred talks about how APCS-P exploded onto the scene and wonders what will happen with APCS this year.
I have some questions as well but mine won&#39;t be answered for years to come, if ever.
Like it or not, the College Board has an out sized influence on K12 education. As long as people are convinced that AP=good there will be a push for more and more AP classes and APCS-P is a perfect class to push.</description>

      <description>This past year I recorded 14 Using Emacs videos. This is on top of the 25 videos I made last year. The fall off in production is understandable. I got through my day to day configuration in the late 20s and since then the videos have just been on things I&#39;ve rediscovered, things that became useful and things that I just found interesting. It was also a busier year.
Why did I start the series?</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a big year for K12 CS education. More and more states looking into CS as a K12 academic area and all that entails, the CS4All movement is well underway and the College Board launched a new exam. These are just three of many big things that happened in the past year.
I&#39;m excited about the overall growth but concerned about a number of issues. I&#39;ve written about all of them in the past so won&#39;t rehash here and in any event, the issues I&#39;m concerned about are issues I have no influence on.</description>

      <description>I usually don&#39;t do year in review posts. At Stuy, not much changed year after year so I never felt it worth summarizing the past and projecting the future. At Hunter, now that I&#39;m a couple of years in, projects are really picking up steam so I think it&#39;s worth talking about them.
One of my two major missions at Hunter was to build a CS Honors program and raise the profile of Hunter&#39;s undergraduate CS program in general.</description>

 I&#39;ve had lots of requests for a video on what I do but I&#39;ve been hesitant for two reasons: There are parts of my configuration that are copied from others and I really don&#39;t understand.</description>

      <description>In the New York City department of education a recurring hot topic is the Absent Teacher Reserve or ATR pool.
A teacher or administrator in the ATR pool is a licensed, most likely tenured teacher not assigned permanently to a school. Each year these educators get shuttled from school to school and denied a chance to actually settle in a position.
The ATR pool was created under the Bloomberg administration. Prior to that, when there was an opening school transfers were basically seniority based and when school had too many teachers the least senior was excessed or basically out of a job until a school with an opening could be found.</description>

  Does anyone have an effective way to teach students how to break down  a problem into steps and then solve each step one by one? I think my  students are struggling with a large question and breaking it in  subsequent parts.  There were some good suggestions. I wanted to add something but didn&#39;t have time then so I thought I&#39;d write it up now.</description>

I was planning on working to catch up but got distracted earlier by this thread on the Advent of Code subreddit. Specifically this comment by Eric Wastl, the contest creator. The thread is about the level of difficulty of the various problems and Eric&#39;s comment talks about some of the factors that go into creating a good collection of problems for a contest and the difficulties involved.</description>

After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other solutions on the Advent of Code subreddit. Even with similar agorithmic solutions there&#39;s a decent amount of variation in the actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically different.</description>

I don&#39;t have attendee stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s once again time for Advent of Code. That one a day programming competition that&#39;s been running now for three years.
Here are some thoughts on day 1. The core of the problem is that you have a large string of digits and you have to calculate a checksum. This is done by adding the sum of a subset of the digits. Only the ones that are identical to the digit to their right.</description>

Each table had two Hunter students and a group of tech professionals. Each table discussed the Hunter CS experience and how the tech community can help support the students. Towards the end of the event a colleague commented that it was a great idea to have the students essentially run the tables and how effective it was.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I&#39;m guessing other high schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who&#39;ve moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far away.</description>

I&#39;ve written a few posts about quicksort. The last time I did a lesson writeup on the subject I wrote about first looking and quickselect and then moving to the quicksort. The class was first faced with the problem of writing a routine to find the Kth smallest item in an unsorted data set.</description>

      <description>One of my goals when I came over to Hunter was to help establish Hunter CS as the place to be for CS in the city. Hunter already had a solid CS program before I joined but it isn&#39;t well known. It also doesn&#39;t have an established tech culture.
It&#39;s an ambitious goal but if it can be done, what a game changer. A lot of people talk about equity, diversity, and social justice but if we can establish Hunter as the place to be for CS in NY, what a win.</description>

      <description>Most mornings, I start my day with a workout. Sometimes I run, sometimes I use my bike trainer. Dealing with plantar fasciitis since last June, it&#39;s mostly been the bike.
I occupy the time by either watching YouTube videos or catching up on Communications of the ACM or American Scientist. I&#39;m about 6 months behind on both.
Inspired by some talk in one of the CS Ed Facebook groups, I thought I&#39;d use the time to start going through some MOOCs.</description>

Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave - one of the best math teachers I know said &#34;you know, every time we have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn&#39;t get annoyed since they&#39;re spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD.</description>

      <description>We all love interesting problems. The trouble is that it&#39;s hard to find suitably interesting problems for students when they&#39;re just learning the basics. In the very beginning the problems practically dictate the solution:
 loop over a list and add all the elements or calculate the sum of a list of integers. Determine if number is prime Convert a word into pig-Latin  It&#39;s not that there&#39;s no thought involved in solving these but the students already know the mechanics of solving these by hand so it&#39;s a direct translation into a program.</description>

I&#39;ve written about Catksills Conf before and I usually describe it as &#34;light tech conference meets summer camp.&#34; I love the event but I love being able to bring my students even more.</description>

      <description>Today was my 50th Birthday. I&#39;m usually pretty low key on birthdays and today was no different. I got up, exercised, went to work, taught my class and went back to my office for office hours.
What a great surprise when all of a sudden my students from last year appeared at my office with a Happy Birthday a card and a cake: It felt pretty terrific. I wasn&#39;t expecting this and was really moved.</description>

      <description>One thing I&#39;ve learned from teaching is that there&#39;s always something new to learn. For the kids, yes, but I&#39;m talking about for the teacher.
The other day, I taught a lesson I&#39;ve taught many times. Find the mode of a data set. That&#39;s the problem that they solve but the lesson is really about run time complexity, hidden complexity and using data structures in alternate ways.
I blogged about this before so you can get an earlier take there although the code isn&#39;t formatted correctly due to blog conversions.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was Catskillsconf - my favorite event of the year. I spent the weekend up in Ulster County with a bunch of my students. some great friends old and new, and Devorah. It was a great weekend but I was mostly offline.
As a result I missed a rather heated discussion in the CS Ed Facebook groups. The debate was over whether or not Strong AP CSP exam results are indicative of a good curriculum or good professional development (PD).</description>

      <description>The big push at last year&#39;s CSTA conference was the release of the new CSTA K12 standards. It seemed that every other session was pushing them in one way or another. I&#39;ve been meaning to share my thoughts about them or, more specifically, learning standards in general for a while but with announcement about federal funding for CS coming from the White House last week I thought it was time.</description>

      <description>I just read Jeff Yearout&#39;s recent post titled The Beginner&#39;s Garden of Concepts. Not directly related but it got me thinking about programming idioms.
I&#39;ve been using the phrase &#34;programming idiom&#34; for years to describe a short useful recurring code construct. I didn&#39;t realize that it was officially &#34;a thing&#34; until doing a web search on the phrase years later.
As our students grow from newbies on I think it&#39;s helpful for them to see recurring and related patterns and programming idioms gives us a name to apply to many beginner patterns.</description>

I&#39;ve had and any number of concerns though.
This past week at the inaugural meeting of New York City&#39;s CSTA chapter we got a taste of the NYC CS4All Blueprint.</description>

People have asked for Magit but I only use the basics and I think there are already some great videos on it out there. I&#39;d also like to get more comfortable with DIRED mode and then do a video on it but I&#39;m not there yet. I&#39;ve also been looking into packages that manage workspaces like Eyebrowse and Persp-mode but neither are really doing it for my workflow.</description>

To answer the tweet, the closet thing I know to a list is Alfred Thompson&#39;s blog roll which is actually a post he wrote on his blog in 2012.</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote about repl.it, an online IDE that supports multiple languages. At the time it had some rudimentary classroom support and since I started using it, repl.it has become better and better. I used it last year with my class because I had to start the year in a lab where I couldn&#39;t easily install my own software. I&#39;ll continue to use repl.it - mostly for it&#39;s ability to schedule publish and manage assignments but when possible, I like having my students work locally.</description>

      <description>People sometimes accuse me of being an elitist CS snob that I feel that CS teachers have to have advanced CS degrees.
It&#39;s not that at all. Rather, I feel that CS teachers are smart and capable. Circumstances frequently result in a teacher in front of a CS class with limited content and pedagogical content knowledge. It&#39;s not ideal but it&#39;s reality. Of course I feel that we should do everything to support and encourage these teachers but we should also insist that after a reasonable period of time, they know their stuff.</description>

TL;DR (although it really isn&#39;t too long so you should read it) - it&#39;s on Laurene Powell Jobs, her efforts to &#34;reform&#34; education and why she&#39;s misguided as are most of the well to do non-educators working hard to change and in many cases privatize public education.
Laura posts a nice list of simple, common sense ways to improve education. I&#39;ll repost them here:</description>

      <description>With the school year starting I was originally planning on writing about my class rules.
Instead I think I&#39;ll riff on Alfred Thompson&#39;s post today titled Curriculum is Hard. I&#39;m guessing I found curriculum design and development daunting decades ago but at this point in my career it&#39;s something I enjoy. In any event, Alfred got me to thinking - when is a curriculum your own?
If you grab a curriculum complete with lesson plans, assignments; the whole kit and caboodle and you use it verbatim it&#39;s clearly not your curriculum.</description>

      <description>At this past year&#39;s CSTA conference, a few of us huddled in a corner voiced a very common lament - &#34;it would be great if more CS teachers blogged.&#34; It really would be. We&#39;re still a relatively small community and while there&#39;s some good conversation going on on mailing lists and on Facebook, those aren&#39;t easily discoverable or accessible and in the case of Facebook, there&#39;s a question of ownership and permanence.</description>

I was going to respond in an email but thought I might share here instead.
  TL;DR - for all you APCS teachers who are new or new to Java - learn  your core CS, lean on your resources and support and it&#39;s OK to tell  your kids &#34;</description>

I still have a few summer topics I want to write about -- standards and side projects in particular but I&#39;m also looking forward to talking more about the classroom since, after all, at my core, I&#39;m a teacher. When I saw this article in my inbox this morning I thought I&#39;d talk about it.</description>

      <description>This morning, I read Alfred Thompson&#39;s post on teaching cybersecurity. as Alfred says, it&#39;s something of a CS Ed buzzword this summer.
Another hot topic in K12 CS Ed this summer is the inclusion of ethics in our CS courses courtesy of efforts like the #ethicalCS twitter chat every Wednesday at 8:00 Eastern time hosted by Saber Khan.
Discussions about both topics include &#34;where should we be doing this?&#34; &#34;What should we be doing?</description>

It took this long because there was a long waiting list at the New York Public Library to get the ebook. I&#39;m still not quite finished with the book but I thought I&#39;d share some of my thoughts on the book and the buzz.</description>

Mark questioned the validity of the piece. If you don&#39;t read Mark&#39;s blog and you&#39;re in CS Ed you probably should.
I tried to leave a comment on Mark&#39;s blog - not about the NY Times article but rather my thoughts on why I think it&#39;s important that we remain wary and vigilant to industry and outsiders influence and impact on CS education and on education in general.</description>

      <description>Brenda Wilkerson, Director of CS and IT education for Chicago public schools was one of the keynote speakers at this year&#39;s CSTA conference. During her talk, she made a comment about it taking three times through to get it right so if you&#39;re working hard and struggling in your first year of teaching CS, it&#39;s not the time to give up. Learning to teach takes time.
She&#39;s absolutely correct. I saw this in myself and I&#39;ve seen this in many other young teachers.</description>

      <description>For anyone involved in K12 CS education, the past few years have been a wild ride. When I first tried to make inroads in the DOE decades ago I couldn&#39;t get through the door. Now, CS Education is everyone&#39;s darling. It&#39;s really amazing. It&#39;s been a combination of grass roots efforts by teachers, non profit education efforts such as TEALS, advocacy of groups like Code.org and amazing individuals like Fred Wilson who has probably done more to move the needle of CS Ed in NY than any other 10 people combined.</description>

      <description>AP scores just came out. As usual, I see the posts and take part in conversations where teachers talk about their results. Some are happy about their results, some aren&#39;t, some don&#39;t really care.
I just want to make a plea to all AP teachers out there:
Don&#39;t let your value be dictated by the college board or any other exam.
I never really cared much about my students&#39; actual AP scores.</description>

      <description>Back in February, I shared my thoughts on losing CS teachers to the tech industy. TL;DR - I don&#39;t think it will be a CS Ed problem.
That said, I do think that it will be hard to find good CS teachers but the reason is because it will get harder and harder to find good teachers in general.
There are plenty of reasons why it&#39;s harder to become a career teacher but I don&#39;t want to talk about those today.</description>

      <description>The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system didn&#39;t work.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been trying to be an active participant on the CS Educators StackExchange. You should try to as well!!!
I answered a question about using the command line which led to a back and forth. I gave an example of something I might do in class to illustrate the power of using the command line and linked to some of my past posts. There was some back and forth in the comments - some of the participants weren&#39;t happy with my code as they felt it was filled with poor coding practices.</description>

      <description>One of the things I mentioned in my post on the CS Educators StackExchange was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate as we&#39;re so young as a community. He&#39;s absolutely right but until we mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and discovering that they don&#39;t know about a site or a mailing list that I&#39;ve known about for years.</description>

      <description>The CS Educators StackExchange is now in public beta. For those of you who are not in tech, StackExchange is a network of question answering sites. StackOverflow is probably the most famous - many peoples go to site for computer science and programming questions and answers.
During this period of public beta the site will be working on defining itself and also on developing a critical mass of users. I hope the site succeeds and I encourage everyone to check it out, ask questions, answer some and let&#39;s all see where this goes.</description>

      <description>A couple of quick, unrelated packages today.
first up, ibuffer. If you keep Emacs open all the time, you&#39;ll start to accumulate buffers. Last time, I talked about using projectile and how that can help when navigating between buffers. IBuffer is another one.
Out of the box, C-x C-b is bound to the Emacs list-buffers** command. It brings up a buffer with all the buffers listed inside it. You can navigate that buffer and hit enter on a particular buffer to go to it.</description>

      <description>Over on Facebook, a fellow CS educator 1 made a comment on something he wanted to try with his students this summer: having the students pre-disclose bugs when they submit their projects.
The post was asking for any links to &#34;the literature.&#34; I can&#39;t speak to that but I I&#39;ve done something similar to what the post was asking about so, as per usual, I thought I&#39;d write about it here.</description>

      <description>Over on the CS Educator StachExchange, which is in private beta for a few more days, I saw a post asking about how to introduce the A* search algorithm.
I taught A* as part of the APCS class at Stuy so I thought I&#39;d talk about what I did here.
Some time around mid year, we get to intermediate recursion. This is about the time, give or take, when we talk about the nlogn sorts.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I read Garth Flint&#39;s latest post on choosing a Python environment for his classes. While our classes and populations are different it looks like Garth and I share a lot of thoughts on the subject.
I started to write a comment to leave on Garth&#39;s blog but since it was getting a little long I thought I&#39;d write it up as a post.
The question of development environment can be an important one and can make a big difference.</description>

Yesterday was my last class for the semester so I thought I&#39;d write a bit about the course.
For the Fall semester, I taught an intro programming course to the entire cohort. For some in the cohort, this was their first exposure to CS.</description>

      <description>I got some nice feedback today from a couple of disparate places. It was another reminder that being a teacher isn&#39;t just about the kids currently in your class but it&#39;s about who you are and everyone you interact with. It&#39;s not just about teaching a subject but rather about helping people get to where they can potentially go.
About a year ago I started putting together a series of posts and videos showing how I use Emacs.</description>

      <description>If you keep Emacs open all the time you end up accumulating lots of buffers. That can make navigating a little bit awkward.
Projectile is a really nice package that makes navigating in and between projects much easier. I also have counsel-projectile installed.
Here&#39;s my configuration:
;; projectile (use-package projectile :ensure t :config (projectile-global-mode) (setq projectile-completion-system &amp;#39;ivy)) (use-package counsel-projectile :ensure t :config (counsel-projectile-on))  Projectile considers a sub-directory tree to be a project if it&#39;s a git or other source control repo, if it&#39;s created by tool like lein, maven, or sbt, or if you put an empty file named **.</description>

      <description>This morning, Mark Guzdial wrote about Stanford possibly moving away from Java as their intro language. This comes on the heels of a semi-regular thread on one of the lists I&#39;m on asking about what languages are used at assorted colleges around the country. Invariably the Pascal - C++ - Java progression of APCS turns up in these threads.
There are plenty of arguments to be made both for and against pretty much any language or platform.</description>

      <description>When I started using git and GitHub with my students it was a natural progression having started with started with CVS and then, as technology changed moving through Subversion and then Mercurial. It was all about using sensible professional software development techniques while making it easier for students to submit work and for me to evaluate their submissions.
Over time, I found that git and GitHub in fact provided some extra support for educators right out of the box.</description>

      <description>Last Friday, Mark Guzdial wrote about the woes of using clickers in a class. The amount of effort required to use his school&#39;s approved clicker technology sounds ridiculous so while we need tools to better engage students in large class settings we need better tools that can be integrated into our classes more easily.
I&#39;ve never used clickers. On top of stories like Mark&#39;s, there are a number of problems with using clickers in a public school.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write this up earlier but, as so frequently happens all my dormant work projects decided it was time to rise up and demand instant attention.
When we left off, we had students pulling code and submitting homework via github.
Form here, it&#39;s an easy step to have them working on a small project in their own repo. In fact, sometimes, I&#39;ll jump right to a two person project where one person creates the repo and invites the other (and me) as a collaborator.</description>

Post starts here: Now that your students have been pulling the classcode repo regularly it&#39;s time to move to the next step - adding and pushing files to a repo.</description>

      <description>Both at and prior to SIGCSE 2017, I promised to write up the steps I take to introduce and use revision control systems in my classes.
This series is not meant to be a git or GitHub tutorial. There are plenty of those already (two of which I&#39;ve linked to below). This is about the process I use with my students to get them up to speed.
As with any new tool, there will be some resistance but once git saves them once, they get religion.</description>

      <description>As a high school teacher, I was never able to attend SIGCSE, the conference of the ACM&#39;s Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education. Between the number of instructional days I would lose and the cost, I could never justify going. Instead I looked over the proceedings and read many of the papers.
 Now that I&#39;m at Hunter, I was finally able to attend. This year in Seattle, the conference ran from Wednesday through Saturday.</description>

I&#39;ve wanted to go for years but have never been able. It&#39;s hard for a high school teacher to miss a week in mid March, particularly in places with a school calendar similar to New York.</description>

The big difference is instead of building on my existing config, the code at the bottom is a complete standalone configuration. It&#39;s all pulled from the main config with one additional package.

      <description>In part 2 I talked about how I used Hyrdas to quickly navigate through elfeed tags. It was a nice step up but the fact that I still had to manually edit my configuration code for every new tag to update the hydra was a problem.
Basically, I had to somehow or other, take a list of all the active tags and with it build a defhydra command that will then make my Hydra.</description>

      <description>If we properly prepare CS teachers, won&#39;t they just jump ship and take  tech industry jobs?  I hear that a lot.
Tech pays big. Teaching? Not so much. Tech workers are respected and have flexible jobs. Teaching? Again, not so much.
Those chanting these refrains advocate the current simple teacher &#34;training&#34; - scripted lessons, minimal pedagogical content knowledge, even less real content knowledge. That will keep them in the classroom.</description>

      <description>In part 1, I talked about elfeed, a really awesome feed reader for emacs. Generally, I&#39;m really liking it but there&#39;s been one problem - not being able to navigate quickly between groups of feeds with a keystroke or two.
It&#39;s emacs so there has to be a solution.
Enter hydra - a terrific emacs package from the same guy who brought us swiper, another one of my favorite emacs packages.</description>

A few days ago, I decided to see what emacs had to offer on the feed reader front. One solution was Gnus but then I&#39;ve never been able to get my head around Gnus. Another was elfeed.
I thought I&#39;d give elfeed a go.</description>

TL;DR, although it isn&#39;t really long and I do encourage you to read Alfred&#39;s post: a couple of articles talk about how the U.S. has the most people entering CS competitions like HackerRank but Americans are not at the top of the leaderboard. does this mean that there&#39;s less talent in America?</description>

      <description>Scheme is one of the languages used in Stuy&#39;s intro CS course. Like any other language, there are pros and cons of using it to introduce students to CS. Here are some of the reasons why I like Scheme as a first language and why despite that, I don&#39;t recommend it in many cases.
Scheme certainly isn&#39;t mainstream. That&#39;s not the main reason why I like it but it is a side benefit.</description>

      <description>I was catching up with the team at Stuy the other day and they mentioned that they were periodically getting pushback on their choice of languages, particularly in the intro class. The pushback was mostly in the form of &#34;why don&#39;t you start them with Javascript?&#34;
Back in the day, when I created our intro class where we use Scheme, NetLogo and then later Python, I&#39;d get similar pushback but then it was &#34;</description>

      <description>One of my favorite but little used emacs features is rectangular editing. It&#39;s little used because I don&#39;t need it all that often. It&#39;s one of my favorites because when I do need it, it&#39;s just so amazingly useful.
The idea is you can mark a rectangle of text, cut it and later paste it. This means that if you have three columns of text:
a b c d e f g h i j k l  You can easily mark the middle column (b e h k) or even just the b e and h, cut it and paste it elsewhere as a rectangle.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m guessing my views on this aren&#39;t very popular -that&#39;s OK, every community needs a curmudgeon.
A few years ago, I cautioned if we weren&#39;t careful, once the big players got involved, CS Ed would go the way of other disciplines, and not in a good way. It looks like indeed we&#39;re well on our way down that road.
I&#39;ve ranted before about things like non-profits, drop in and summer programs.</description>

Also, like many of my fellow bloggers and tweeters, this week has provided a reason to break with that tradition.
Many people, including some friends, all more eloquent than I have already posted, tweeted, and Facebooked about the behavior of our President and government.</description>

I&#39;m a command line wonk and adding command line goodness and emacs together seems like a natural. Maybe it&#39;s because back in the day I spent a lot of time on MS-DOS systems. You could get a reasonable Unixy facsimile using tools like the MKS toolkit and I like so many other young computer scientists wrote our own small shells when we learned C so I used that insted of command.</description>

      <description>What essential topics should we teach in our intro courses? This seems to be a recurring topic recently.
It can be an important topic but, unfortunately, too often, it seems that people have too myopic a view
I remember thinking about this years ago when APCS moved from C++ to Java. Both languages have good and bad points both for practical and educational use. A big loss in the move to Java was memory management and the topics you could cover when memory issues arose.</description>

I was waiting to see if I liked my current setup - using org-gcal to sync with my Google Calendar for appointments while using my main org file for my todo list.</description>

      <description>Over on Facebook, a friend commented on my last post. He commented on the rigor of BA vs BS degrees. The comment mentioned Physics and Math degrees but I thought Id follow up a bit on CS degrees.
I took a quick look at three computer science programs - Cornell, UMich, and Queens College. Cornell because my daughter is there, UMich, my son, and Queens College because it&#39;s a CUNY college that offers both a BS and a BA in computer science.</description>

      <description>I didn&#39;t know Hunter College had computer science.  I heard that refrain more than once during my fall visits to high schools. Part of the reason for this is due to Hunter CS&#39;s low profile and small size in spite of its high quality.
Part, though, was also because of some misconceptions about Computer Science programs. I&#39;d hear things like &#34;but they only offer a BA not a BS,&#34;</description>

Tramp mode allows you to edit remote files using your local emacs. I usually do this over ssh.
To edit a file on a machine www.cstuy.org I would first **find-file** using C-c C-f and then for the file name to open:
/ssh:www.cstuy.org:/home/zamansky/sc/testfile  this would open the file testfile in the absolute directory **/home/zamansky/sc**. If my username on the remote machine is different:</description>

I wanted to share some recommendations on things to explore with a few student groups and thought it would be easier to write those recommendations down here once and then just share a link.</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s Advent of Code problem was a variant on the Josephus problem.
I recalled that there was a formula to figure out the sole survivor but I decide to run a simulation rather than looking it up. I also decided to write it up in C++, well, really C with cout instead of printf.
Part 1 was the traditional problem. Part 2 was a variant where at each iteration, you remove the elf opposite the elf being processed (see the problem description for details).</description>

Danny, the Maestro, or Doc, as we sometimes called him spent most of his career at Stuyvesant. First as a math teacher, then math chair. Danny also spent time as the director of the Bergen Academies and his last few years as the Chief Academic Officer at Solomon Schecter in Bergen.</description>

I very much enjoyed the semester and my class and look forward to working with the same group when the spring term starts in a few weeks.
At the same time, even though I&#39;m a quarter century veteran teacher, in many ways this was like my rookie season all over again.</description>

This hasn&#39;t left much time for Advent of Code but I did manage to finish yesterday&#39;s challenge this morning.

      <description>Today we&#39;re looking at Advent of Code 2016 number 2.
To change things up, I thought I&#39;d do a video where I live code a solution.
The solution I present is pretty straightforward - use a 2D array (or technically, an array of strings) to represent the keypad, parse the input, and follow the input instructions to build the code.
One of the things I really like about Advent of Code is that every problem has two parts and depending on how you solved part 1, you may or may not have extra work to do for part 2.</description>

      <description>I recently posted about Advent of Code - a series of programming problems relseased one a day. While they vary in terms of level of difficulty, a number of them make nice problems for introductory to mid level programming classes.
I thought I&#39;d share some of my thoughts on a few of them starting with the first problem from this years competition.
Take a minute to read it over.
At first glance, it might seem to a young programmer that this problem requires a two dimensional array - all about (x,y) coordinates but then there&#39;s a problem - there are no limits on coordinates and we can&#39;t make an unlimited size array.</description>

      <description>Once again, it&#39;s time for Advent of Code - a series of small programming problems released once a day.
I wrote a bit about it last year and you can still find last years problems here.
It&#39;s only day three but so far, all of the problems look really nice for students in APCS-A or any similar intro course. I&#39;m thinking of looking at a couple of the problems this week with my class at Hunter.</description>

      <description>Not much in today&#39;s actual post. The video is a continuation of the last one on org-capture.
The video goes over how I set things up to pop up a new frame to do a capture even if emacs isn&#39;t on screen (as long as it&#39;s running) by hitting F1. I would have preferred to bind to C-c c - the same as within emacs but I havn&#39;t figured out how to do that in Ubuntu or Mint Linux yet.</description>

  If called upon, would you take a job in an administration who&#39;s policies you strongly  disagreed with?  Would you go work for an administration that you reviled in order to get a seat at the table? To try to affect change from the inside or would you consider yourself a sellout or worse, publicly promote positions you disagree with.</description>

Probably that the manual seemed a little intimidating.

I decided to use Python with a transition at the end to C++. The transition is to mirror Hunter&#39;s normal first CS course that ends with a C++ intro to prepare the students for next semester&#39;s CS course which is a more intense OOP class using C++ - the language we use in our core courses.</description>

It&#39;s from 2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place.</description>

The video goes over web-mode - my preferred weapon for html and all the goodies you embed in an html file.
It&#39;s multi-modal so it acts sensibly regardless of wether you&#39;re editing html, css, javascript or even templates in a single file.
Note: In the video, web-mode wasn&#39;t automatically inserting quotes. I had to set hte following variable to fix this:

This video is really setting the stage for hte next two, where I talk about org-mode capturing.
Today, we&#39;re demoing the use of the emacs server and client.
Back in the old days, emacs took a LOOONG time to load. A complex conviguration could take on the order of 10 to 20 seconds. This resulted in people loading emacs at the start of the day and leaving it up forever.</description>

We got some comments on alternate ways to load a file if it exists - it&#39;s always cool to see how different people end up doing similar things.
We then talk about three little configurations. Two I found out about reading Jon Sander&#39;s (jcs) blog Irreal. Jon&#39;s blog is a terrific source of emacs info - if you don&#39;t subscribe, you should.</description>

It seems that Stuyvesant hasn&#39;t had that many semi finalists, finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn&#39;t happy about it.</description>

It&#39;s also a little annoying changing between my full emacs config and the one I&#39;m developing here.
So, I decided to move to this config for my real config and as I make more videos move parts of my old configuration over to this new one.</description>

The first covers setting up a droplet (virtual server) on DigitalOcean. The second, deploying a flask application using Green Unicorn, and the third, using sshfs to remotely mount your files from your DO box to your local machine and how to set up DNS using FreeDNS.
To help you on your way with DigitalOcean, here are links to a few of their tutorials</description>

      <description>I meant to cover these last time but decided not to so as to keep the videos to about 10 minutes each.
First up this time round is iedit - a really cool mode that lets you select all the instances of the marked selection at the same time and edit them all at once. By default it&#39;s bound to C-l.
For example, let&#39;s say you had the following code:</description>

As a Crit Advisor, I, along with two other people from the tech industry have a give and take with three groups and hopefully we can provide useful feedback.</description>

      <description>If you know me you know that my morning reads include a visit over to avc.com, Today, Fred&#39;s post talked about development and progress, evolution, if you would, in the city. Although not directly related, it got me thinking about gentrification.
To me, gentrification all too often seems to result in pushing out people and business that were there during the hard times.
We don&#39;t need to force out long time residents that can no longer make rent - we need to uplift communities with pathways to towards greater economic opportunity.</description>

This time, we&#39;re looking at a few small packages that I use all the time.
Highlight line Mode (global-hl-line-mode t)  this turns on highlight line mode. It makes it easy to see the line the cursor&#39;s on.</description>

Last year, Devorah joined me and also enjoyed the show.
If you know my wife, you know she&#39;s always knitting. Ok, not true, she&#39;s always knitting, spinning, weaving or performing some other form of fiber craft.
I can&#39;t complain. That&#39;s how I ended up with my Kandinsky, Dust Puppy and Yoda sweaters and my awesome Kang and Kodos socks.</description>

Last year, Devorah and I attended the first Catskillsconf, a tech conference in Olivebridge, NY. It was an amazing and unique experience. I can only describe it as Tech Conference meets Summer camp. Where else can you hear talks by people like Dennis Crowley and an alos hear the music of Mike and ruthy.
This year, I gave another educaiton rant and to add to the fun, Devorah&#39;s been leading a knitting for Charity project and teaching attendees to knit:</description>

      <description>Those laptops that my Hunter students were supposed to get have finally arrived. We&#39;re distributing them on Monday. Each student will have a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 for as long as they&#39;re in the program.
This means we can finally start using the web as a way of displaying and sharing our projects.
For this type of web development, I&#39;m a big fan of using Flask. Flask is a Python microframework.</description>

      <description>If you use emacs, you should keep an eye on Jon Snader&#39;s blog, irreal.org. A few days he posted on Undo Tree - a package that extends Emacs&#39;s built in undo functionality.
Basic emacs has undo, bound to C-/ or C-_ but that&#39;s about it. Undo tree, which you can set up with:
(use-package undo-tree :ensure t :init (global-undo-tree-mode))  adds two key features. First is redo, which you get by adding the shift key to the undo keychords.</description>

      <description>The discussion today over on AVC was Chromebooks in K12, a title I conveniently lifted.
In the comments, I was asked my thoughts on chromebooks vs Linux on low end hardware so, here they are.
Chromebooks are cheap, near instant on, and, if you&#39;re using Google Apps for education, little to no administration necessary.
This is a HUGE win for schools.
There are some issues. School WiFi, for example, is frequently insufficient which can be a problem for a device that&#39;s meant to be connected to the cloud.</description>

This morning, I read a viewpoint by Jeremy Scott and Alan Bundy on a program in Scotland. If you&#39;re an ACM member, and if you&#39;re a CS practitioner, student, academic, or teacher you should be, you can read the piece for details.</description>

      <description>Saw this post the other day: Emacs is hurting Clojure and this response: Is Emacs Really HJard to Learn / Use.
This called to mind those countless discussions about tools being user friendly. I&#39;m frequently on the unpopular side of these discussions. Linux vs Windows vs Mac, Shell vs GUI, Emacs vs fill-in-the-blank-editor-or-IDE and on and on.
Don&#39;t use Emacs, it isn&#39;t user friendly. Don&#39;t use Linux, it isn&#39;t user friendly.</description>

Last Thursday I spent an afternoon and evening with NYCIST members for a discussion of the state of K12 Computer Science Education in the City.
Most of my work has been with public schools and most of the teachers I know, public school teachers so it was great to make new friends in the Independent school community.</description>

      <description>The day after Labor Day. The day NYC teachers traditionally return to work. For the first time in a quarter century, I&#39;m not one of them.
It&#39;s weird.
Instead, I&#39;m in the second week of Hunter College&#39;s fall semester. So far so good on that front. I&#39;m getting to know my students, planning activities and overall having a good time.
But, I do have to reflect on some of the things I&#39;m not going to get to do this week:</description>

      <description>We&#39;re now a week in to my first class at Hunter. It&#39;s a little early for me to really compare and contrast the high school to college experience but I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts on a tool that I&#39;ve recently started to play with.
My students were all supposed to be issued laptops at the beginning of the semester. The plan was to have them learn Linux, the command line, and a little DevOps along the way.</description>

Probably because I&#39;m excited to be working with my new class and we&#39;re working in Python. We&#39;re not going to be using C+++ for a few months so I&#39;ll get to those videos a little later.
Today, I want to cover what I consider a leatherman or multi-tool for Emacs. Something that isn&#39;t perfect for any particular job but can get almost any job done: Macros.</description>

      <description>I saw this headline earlier today: The U.S. Just Made a Bold Move to Improve Diversity in Tech.
The article talks about a program by which a number of code schools will be able to accept federal student aid. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re talking student loans or grants but I&#39;m not sure it matters.
The headline sounds great. I&#39;m not so sure that this is a good thing.
My thinking&#39;s evolved over the years but right now, everything tells me that public funds and for profit education don&#39;t mix.</description>

      <description>It turns out that Elpy, a popular emacs package for python development is much easier to set up than I remember. It turns out all you need is:
(use-package elpy :ensure t :config (elpy-enable))  The video shows how to install and a bit of use. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a package I&#39;m going to use much since I use other tools to do similar things but it&#39;s worth checking out.</description>

I&#39;m an educator, not a professional developer so I&#39;m not working in huge code bases with dozens or more files at a time. I do periodically work in medium size code bases and will talk about cross file navigation and project management later on. There are also more powerful emacs Python packages. One being elpy.

My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who&#39;s interning out there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up with over 100 former students. If you&#39;re interested in seeing more, I wrote a bit about it here.
I was originally going to start talking about Python development but then saw this post on reddit about reveal.</description>

      <description>If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching career, then our family&#39;s West Coast swing was a nice way to pull down the curtain.
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she&#39;s interning at Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle for a couple of days.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I read over Hillary&#39;s briefing on her initiative on Technology and Innovation.
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have my doubts. My feeling is that she&#39;s pretty much aligned with the current administration education wise and the current administration has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public education.
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much like some of the others, I don&#39;t want to get into that today.</description>

Some of the comments touched on mentors and role models so I though I&#39;d talk a little about that here.
I&#39;ve always believed that as a parent, modeling - that is, how we behave is one of the largest shapers of our kids. It&#39;s one thing to take your kid to a museum because that&#39;s what you should do as a good parent and another if you think - &#34;</description>

Like most editors, Emacs can be extensively themed.
As shown in the video, you can quickly see the built in themes using the customize-themes command.
You can load one of these themes by using the load-theme command interactively or, more likely by putting:
(load-theme &amp;#39;leuven t)  in your init.el. The above code loads the built in leuven theme.</description>

      <description>Out of the box, Emacs supports various types of completion.
Tab completion for filenames and commands basically work right out of the box and Emacs has built in modes like Abbrev, Hippie Expand, and Dabbrev provide a manner of completion for in buffer text.
I briefly show Dabbrev (Dynamic Abbrevs) in the video and if you&#39;re interested in the others, follow the links.
We saw ow the built in Ido mode and third party packages like Ivy, which I prefer, and Helm make for better completions on functions, filenames, and the like and Emacs also has third party packages for in buffer completion.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a really cool navigation method that I&#39;ve been meaning to use more. Avy is a replacement for ace-jump mode which is an implementation of easymotion, a vim plugin.
It&#39;s pretty cool and lets you quickly navigate to any spot on the screen.
After triggering avy, or more specifically the **avy-goto-char** function, emacs prompts you for a single character. When you type it, all instances of the character that start out words change to a highlighted letter.</description>

      <description>I spent last Saturday up at the Microsoft offices in Times Square observing a TEALS training session. My fried Nathaniel Granor, Teals Regional Manager in the east has invited me a number of times and this time I was able to make it.
If you don&#39;t know, TEALS is a program that takes volunteers in the tech industry and places them in classrooms. Unlike other programs, the TEALS volunteers work with the teachers while the kids learn some CS.</description>

      <description>The other day my friend and fellow CS Ed Blogger Alfred Thompson wrote about Better Comments, an extension for visual studio that displays comments that are marked up with special characters in order to highlight them. Here&#39;s a screenshot:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omsharp/BetterComments/master/screenshots/ClassificationC.png
So, the first thing I though was &#34;I bet emacs could do that pretty easily&#34; and down the rabbit hole I went.
I had to figure out something about how emacs themes and font-locking (emacs for syntax highlighting) works and of course spent far too much time learning about Emacs, my favored tool, rather than getting actual work done, but I came up with this:</description>

      <description>This video is all about using incremental search to navigate through your emacs buffers.

You can use the default incremental searchb, bound to C-s for isearch-forward C-r to search backwards (reverse).
They work really well as is but I prefer using Swiper. The video demos both and the Swiper home page has loads of details.
Part of the Swiper package includes ivy and counsel which I use instead of ido.</description>

I&#39;ve played with robotics on and off over the years ranging from building them from (not using) scratch using Atmel chips and programming them in assembly to using Arduino based platforms to using pre-built robot platforms. They&#39;re really cool and since they interact with the real world you can do all sorts of interesting and motivational things with students.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the delay in getting this next video / post up. I spent the last part of last week at The Personal Democracy Forum 2016 which is really an exceptional conference.
I posted a bit about it in my last post and plan to write some more on it, but for now, more Emacs.

This video concerns using windows. By using buffers and windows and the basics you got from the tutorial, you shouldn&#39;t have to ever leave emacs.</description>

At their core, Math Circles are math outreach and enrichment programs. I&#39;m most familiar with the New York Math Circle. I&#39;m friends with many of their teachers and organizers and my son took part in their summer program for a couple of years.</description>

      <description>Many people think of Emacs as an editor. I like to think of it as an Elisp interpreter where you live code documents.
In some ways, it&#39;s like those new fangled interactive programming environments where you type in code and the updates are reflected instantly.
In this video, I try to explain the way I think about Emacs and why it&#39;s so cool.

      <description>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;ve been an Emacs wonk for decades. Since the mid-80&#39;s in fact. I&#39;ve spent time using other editors, word processors, and development tools but always find my way back.
I recommend that budding computer science students develop a good tool set and encourage them to explore Emacs but while it&#39;s pretty easy to load Emacs and find your way around, particularly if you use the mouse and menus there isn&#39;t a clear path to take you from beginner to using it as an efficient tool let alone customizing it.</description>

      <description>This video will step you through setting up Emacs to use MELPA for packages.

We configured emacs by creating a folder named .emacs.d and creating a file within it named init.el.
Here&#39;s the contents of that file:
(setq inhibit-startup-message t) (require &amp;#39;package)(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)(add-to-list &amp;#39;package-archives &amp;#39;(&amp;#34;melpa&amp;#34; . &amp;#34;https://melpa.org/packages/&amp;#34;))(package-initialize);; Bootstrap `use-package&amp;#39; (unless (package-installed-p &amp;#39;use-package)(package-refresh-contents)(package-install &amp;#39;use-package)) (use-package try :ensure t) (use-package which-key :ensure t :config (which-key-mode))   The last two inituse-package clauses install two helpful packages: *try*: let&#39;s you try packages without installing them.</description>

It&#39;s also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a distance.
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating.
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend Ria recently asked a question on Facebook about it.</description>

I left a comment but thought I&#39;d elaborate here.
No, knowing HTML is not programming - it&#39;s markup. Even so, when I help people design CS programs, I&#39;ll frequently recommend starting with HTML or at least introducing it early.
Why?
It&#39;s a gateway and not just to programming.
HTML is pretty easy, you want something bold, you just wrap the word in &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; and ==:</description>

      <description>Some good points in the Facebook comments on my last post. One notable comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn&#39;t be able to gain the traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true but also sad that we&#39;ve awarded such educational authority to a private company that&#39;s accountable to no one. Schools should run courses because they&#39;re good for kids not specifically because they&#39;re AP.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don&#39;t trust our high school teachers.
I usually use phrases like &#34;society doesn&#39;t trust&#34; but let&#39;s personalize it this time -- for parents, think about whether or not you trust your kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization more?</description>

      <description>Edit: Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the comments, this post isn&#39;t about what&#39;s appropriate for HS CS. It&#39;s more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it high school, college, code school, or other.
Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.
The two examples are just to illustrate the point.</description>

CSTUY&#39;s not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
That&#39;s not something I&#39;m happy about but part of me knew it might happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn&#39;t have, was the role that the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.</description>

We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the fact that in my new position, I didn&#39;t have the time to do the necessary fund-raising and outreach.</description>

 Having just concluded almost a quarter century at one job in one place, I&#39;ve been reflecting on a number of things.  What I accomplished, what I&#39;ve failed to accomplish, highlights, low lights and everything in between.  I&#39;ve also learned a lot over these twenty five years.  One thing I learned is DevOps and System Administration.  Back around 1993 or 1994 Stuy wasn&#39;t really on the internet.</description>

 SoftDev students are hard at work on their final projects. By now, they all have fairly complex code bases. This limits how much I can help them with debugging.  There are some problems, though, that they have to contend with that even with experience, are hard to spot. Notably because the very tools you use to debug these errors are part of the problem.  Last week, this happened twice.</description>

    Last time we took a look at implementing a Cellular Automaton in NetLogo to do some simple image manipulation. We just scratched the surface. In class, the kids write pretty nice Photoshop Light applications.  Today we&#39;ll look at some more ambitious problem solving - using a Cellular Automaton to find a path through a maze.</description>

 We&#39;ve been using NetLogo in our intro course for years. It&#39;s a wonderful programming environment. Many of you recall the Logo programming language. NetLogo is like Logo but instead of programming a turtle, you write a program that&#39;s run by multiple, perhaps hundreds of turtles and also by the world the turtles live on.  Some of the reasons we like it are that it&#39;s: An easy accessible textual programming language Makes building a graphical interface trivial great for modeling Comes with tons of demo models</description>

 In response to the past couple of days where my friends and fellow CS Ed advocates Alfred Thompson, Rob Underwood, and I had a nice little discussion via our blogs, Alfred wrote this.  It&#39;s great when a number of voices in the community have an open discussion but one of the things I found myself lamenting was the fact that a lot of the discussion isn&#39;t truly accessible.</description>

 The other day, Alfred Thompson put up a piece about coding in multiple languages. Alfred references a post written last May by Rob Underwood.  Both pieces are worth a look.  Rob is trying to illustrate many of the superficial similarities in popular languages.  In the comments on Alfred&#39;s blog, both Alfred and I alluded to coding in an appropriate style for the language.</description>

 Almost twenty six years. That&#39;s how long I&#39;ve been a NYC public school teacher. Most of that time at my alma mater, Stuyvesant.  A couple of years ago, the school paper wrote up an overview of my career. I re-posted it here. I&#39;m somtimes amazed at where we are now and how we got here.  Regulars here also know my frustrations. To Stuy, I&#39;m an interchangeable, generic math teacher and the DOE has shown no interested in supporting what we&#39;ve built.</description>

 I wish our kids believed us when we tell them that we have the same programming troubles as they do. We stare at code for hours not seeing problems that could be a simple as passing the wrong value. We spend an inordinate amount of time trying to see the problem and then realize that we just forgot something silly.  At this point, it&#39;s common for us CS teachers to tell each other &#34;</description>

I came to the party a little late so I&#39;m only up to day 6.  Each problem comes in two parts. The second is revealed after you complete the first.</description>

We love last years hosts SumAll and are grateful that they continue to host our Saturday Hacking Sessions but we are also grateful to Facebook NY for allowing us to use their larger space for this edition of def hacks().</description>

An interesting discussion followed.  It reminded me of a time I was talking to a few senior engineers at a large tech company.</description>

Rather than the normal nonsense - forcing CS teachers to sit through common core math lectures or how to use the latest calculator, our host principal, Randy Asher, of Brooklyn Tech let us do our thing.  Basically, it was a bunch of CS teachers from two schools - Stuy and Brooklyn Tech, talking shop for most of the day.</description>

 As a teacher, sometimes your gut tells you to do something and it turns out to be a really good idea.  That&#39;s what happened in October, 1994. I decided to dress up as Groo the Wanderer for Halloween. I never dressed in costume for school before and back then, no many did. A few students and very few teachers.  Afterwards, I noticed that my younger students - the ones that didn&#39;t know me that well yet, really loosened up and so a tradition was born.</description>

We don&#39;t get up there as much as we should - usually just for apple picking and then for the New York Sheep and Wool Festival.  It&#39;s a region with great food, hiking, natural beauty, history and more.  So, what exactly is growing?  The Hudson Valley Tech community.  I first heard about what Hudson Valley was doing around Tech back at the August New York Tech Meetup.</description>

I recommend that my students spend time not only in Emacs but also in tools like Vim or Sublime Text.</description>

So, how will my colleagues and I spend the rest of the day?  Proctoring the PSAT.  This has always been a sore point with me. Back in the day, many schools, Stuy included, offered the PSAT on the weekend. If you wanted to proctor, you&#39;d come in and get paid a little extra.</description>

Why did I choose them?  There are a number of coding schools with varying levels of hype around them.</description>

 Funny story from yesterday.  Devorah, my better half, is an assistant principal at another high school. Yesterday evening, she was at work late for &#34;curriculum night.&#34; Parents came to the school after hours to hear a variety of presentations.  During her presentation, Devorah mentioned her name, that she had two former public school kids in college, and that&#39;s about it for the personal info.</description>

  Today we kicked off Hacking Sessions 2015. Saturday morning with sixty kids in a room brainstorming ideas. Soon they&#39;ll settle on teams and projects and we&#39;ll be off for a semester of exploring CS and tech.  The next couple of weeks will be a little chaotic with groups shifting, mentors figuring out which groups to work with and us, the instructors launching each team on its way.</description>

 I was brought up on Gilberg and Sullvan. My father, who always wanted to be an opera singer sang with LOOM back in the day and there was always classical music playing. Either from the Hi Fi or my father singing.  Recently, there&#39;s been a kerfufle over what was to be NYGASP&#39;s production of Mikado.  My son, Natan wrote a terrific blog post on it and the suspension of belief in opera.</description>

      <description>div.center {text-align:center;}    Earlier this week, Mayor Bill deBlasio announced some ambitious CS Education Plans for NYC. I posted a response here. Now that a few days past, I thought I&#39;d clear a few things up.  First and foremost, I hope my concerns are unfounded and I hope the plan is a tremendous success.  What&#39;s got me bummed is not that I need to see my name in lights given that in many ways I&#39;ve been a CS Ed trailblazer (although who doesn&#39;t like a little ego stroking), rather that in my humble opinion NY has squandered a great opportunity and resource and as a results, kids won&#39;t get nearly all they could.</description>

 The NY Times just posted an article - the mayor announced a 10 year deadline by which time all NYC public school students will be taking CS.  I should be happy.  I&#39;m not.  I feel thoroughly defeated.  As many of you know, I&#39;ve struggled for years to try to bring CS education to more kids and to train more teachers. You also probably know that over the years, I&#39;ve become pretty good at this.</description>

      <description>div.center text-align:center;    This post is in response to an email thread on the NYTM mailing list. I mentioned how the NYC DOE refused to even look at our program at Stuy let alone support us and help us get to more kids.  Rather than pollute an email thread, I said I&#39;d write up the story here.  I&#39;ve been at the CS Ed game for a long time.</description>

      <description>div.center {text-align:center;}    We talked about setting kids up to fail in math. What about CS?  Well, it&#39;s a little subtler.  I started thinking about this after a conversation with one of my graduates about Harvard&#39;s famous CS50. Since that conversation, I&#39;ve spoken to a number of my kids that have gone through CS50 and most seem to say the same things: They don&#39;t really teach anything  The kids rely on a group member who already knows stuff or will learn all the stuff on their own  If it weren&#39;t for my StuyCS background my group would have really struggled.</description>

 As many of you know, I&#39;m part of the team behind CSTUY, a non-profit dedicated to bringing the best CS education to kids who wouldn&#39;t otherwise have the opportunity.  Over the past two summers we&#39;ve hosted our highly succesful immersion program SHIP. We were also able to run a small Saturday program thanks to the generosity of SumAll who provided space, and other members of the StuyCS family who provided laptops and the funds we needed.</description>

 &#34;Four in ten NYC high schools don&#39;t offer Algebra 2 and both Physics and Chemistry.&#34;  At least that&#39;s what this article and linked report say.  The implication is clear - many of our students don&#39;t have the opportunity to advance in math and the sciences.  The truth though is much more disturbing.  The reason why these schools aren&#39;t offering Algebra 2 is very simple - the kids aren&#39;t ready for it.</description>

 Today was the last day of SHIP 2015, CSTUY&#39;s summer immersion program. I was blown away by the projects. The shipmates and the stewards all did tremendous work.  All through the reception parents would come up to me and rave about the job I did with the program. They&#39;d thank me, tell me how exited their child was every day, how proud they were of what they were learning and on and on.</description>

Largest expansion is pretty clear but are the largest gain in 3+ scores mean a higher percentage of 3+ scores or merely the result of more test takers?

 For the past two years we&#39;ve been allowed to run 7 sections of AP Computer Science with about 30 kids per class.</description>

Up at a school on East 96th street grading the geometry regents.  Back in the day schools gave exams then schools graded exams. Typically by committee. You&#39;d get a room full of math teachers, each teacher would take a problem or two and we&#39;d work through class envelopes.</description>

The fifty participants, came from all over the city, Long Island, and New Jersey. They ranged from having never programmed to three or four years experience.  Projects ranged from web sites to full stack applications.</description>

 I&#39;m a born and bred New Yorker and more and more I&#39;m lamenting what the city&#39;s becoming.  New York used to be a collection of neighborhoods. Yes, we were the city that never slept, but there were scores of mom and pop stores, sole proprieterships. You could become a &#34;regular.&#34; I&#39;m reminded of Tom Shachman&#39;s book Around the Block which looks at the businesses around a single NYC block, mostly all gone now.</description>

 When starting the spring semester, students are frequently a little rusty. They just had a high intensity month of study, tests, and projects. That was followed by a week of nothing.  I like to start with something lightweight that gets them coding again and ramps them up to speed.  In SoftDev I started with a brief overview of the HTML5 canvas and then gave them a small homework assignment to do something fun.</description>

Afterwards a few of us were chatting and a friend observed that when she first started to talk to high school kids she was shocked that they really didn&#39;t know the local tech players - neither names nor companies.  A couple of years ago, another friend was helping me organize an event for high schoolers.</description>

 I just read Alfred Thompson&#39;s predictions for next year. I was going to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long winded, I thought I&#39;d comment in a post of my own.  If you haven&#39;t read Alfred&#39;s post yet, check it out: http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:  Alfred&#39;s probably right but I&#39;m leery. Sure, it could end up terrific but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.</description>

I&#39;ve heard some of my graduates referred to as rock stars - top tech people, and in fact I&#39;ve seen some of them courted for positions in a manner that a rock star might be accustomed to.</description>

 Yesterday, my buddy Stan pointed me to this article: &#34;To address tech’s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom&#34;  It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.</description>

 About a month ago, I was at my 30 year high school reunion. Yesterday I was at the class of 2009&#39;s 5 year one. Stuy 2004 also had their 10 year reunion last night.  It&#39;s always nice to be invited to reunions - I know it&#39;s largely dependent on who&#39;s on the organizing committee but it&#39;s nice to be remembered.  Last time I wrote about Stuy reunions I noted how similar they all are.</description>

We&#39;re building a word search generator and we&#39;re at the point where we need to read a list of words from a file  First, I&#39;d better make sure I can do it. We&#39;re using the java scanner, mostly because it&#39;s easy.  First cut: public class wl { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(&#34;</description>

 I&#39;ve said it many times:   Never use a tool you couldn&#39;t write yourself. 
 That is - make sure you understand what&#39;s going on under the hood.  In AP we&#39;ve been playing with ArrayLists. The problem for today? Create an ArrayList with consecutive integers and then write a routine that will randomize the ArrayList.  For example, you might start with this ArrayList: 0,1,2,3,4,5</description>

 That&#39;s how I introduce myself whenever I attend a former student&#39;s wedding. It leads to all sorts of confusion.  Even better was the time I was at the wedding of two former students. I had just dropped around 65 pounds and was wearing my hair differently. I sat at a table filled with former students that didn&#39;t recognize me &amp;#x2013; they had no reason to expect me, out of context and all.</description>

  How many times do we teach something and leave the kids thinking:  &#34;what&#39;s the point of this?&#34; &#34;When will I use this?&#34; or even just the plain old fashioned &#34;that&#39;s weird.&#34;  It&#39;s pretty cool when a lesson starts out that way but you get to the payoff by the end of the class.  Today we started exploring some advanced python.  We started by showing that you can assign functions to variables or pass them as parameters: def inc(x): return x+1 def dec(x): return x-1</description>

 We&#39;ll get back to CS content soon, but for now:  Last Tuesday was Election day - no students in the school - a day devoted to professional development. Traditionally, math team coaches from around the city descend on Stuy for a day full of lectures, discussion, and general catching up. I&#39;ve never actually attended these meetings. In the past, they were for math team coaches only and this year, I was actually allowed to do something with the CS teachers.</description>

 Earlier today I saw a friend&#39;s Facebook post questioning the sanity of common core math. He had an issue with the way his daughter was being forced to work out problems. A few of us chimed in with our low op pinion on Common Core, others said they thought it was a good idea. I think the fact that my buddy was questioning it is a major strike against CC.</description>

 Little did I know that a goof of an idea would turn into a twenty year tradition. This year, I had a chance to team up with Natan in his senior year. Last time we had a Zamansky family duo for Halloween it was Batya cameoing in our Austin Powers - Dr. Evil sketch.</description>

  In a few hours Devorah and I will be off to our thirty year high school reunion. It&#39;s going to be a boat ride - reminiscent of those excursion day trips to Bear Mountain that Stuy had back in the day.  Having taught CS at Stuy for the last twenty plus years, I&#39;ve also been invited to my share of reunions as a teacher.</description>

 If I&#39;m doing my job right, by the time my kids graduate they can learn on their own.  It&#39;s like when two years ago, before starting her summer internship, Batya listed all the tools and technologies she had to work with. When I pointed out that she hadn&#39;t ever used any of them before and asked how she was going to deal with it, she replied &#34;</description>

 It&#39;s hard to believe that this is my 25th year teaching and that my first StuyCS class graduated in June 1995. It&#39;s really hard to believe that I&#39;m now looking at the end of a significant part of my life and career.  Over the summer, Mariya, Kachun, and Stella, all writers for Stuy&#39;s Spectator worte an article that chronicled StuyCS. It&#39;s a really nice piece.</description>

  I originally wrote about the system here and a little more here.     Well, the results are in and I got my evaluation. What type of teacher am I? According to New York City I&#39;m &#34;Effective,&#34; which is basically run of the mill.</description>

  One of the most important, possibly the most important part of SHIP&#39;s success was the crew and that&#39;s what sets us apart.  I&#39;ve seen CS Ed organizations run by business people, lawyers, investors and more.The people developing curriculum are EdTech people, entrepreneurs and anything but seasoned educators. I&#39;ve seen programs developed, curriculum created and then the search for teachers commence.</description>

  From the day we filed the paperwork to create CSTUY, we knew we wanted to run a summer program. In fact, we started looking for a space during the 2012/2013 school year. We were hoping to run SHIP for the first time in the summer of 2013 but we all knew it wasn&#39;t really a realistic goal.     Our original plans required at least one classroom sized space, and up to three for full days for a month.</description>

  First you&#39;ve got claims like &#34;learn how to make a mobile app in under n weeks.</description>

  Much like the Love Boat had every week, at CSTUY SHIP, we too have our guest stars.  On the one hand, it&#39;s important to have a focused program that leaves the shipmates empowered to continue their CS studies on their own. That means the shipmates have to explore something with sufficient depth so that the learning sticks.</description>

SHIP will be running starting this Monday through the end of July and should be a great adventure.

This year, I asked each group to make a short video.  First up, we&#39;ve got bit&amp;lt;&amp;lt;shift - a search engine for code.</description>

 One of the things I love about StuyCS is that we&#39;ve built a true Geek culture.  Last week, we had a last minute visitor - Stephen Wolfram. Well known for Mathematica and more importantly, Wolfram Alpha, without which our students wouldn&#39;t be able to complete all their homework.  The only problem was that we had about 24 hours from when the visit was confirmed til the talk was to take place.</description>

I&#39;d actually write up the event but Fred Wilson&#39;s already done a better job at that than I could: http://avc.com/2014/05/dream-it-and-code-it/  As Fred stated on his blog, it&#39;s a real shame that the high schooler&#39;s didn&#39;t get to show off their work but it was great to see that there were entries from a variety of schools including The Academy for Software Engineering and The Young Women&#39;s Leadership Academy.</description>

 We do lots of different things to engage the kids in a lot of different ways and I love it when someone comes up with a new technique.</description>

Well, we&#39;ve been hard at work getting things together for our first summer program: SHIP - Summer Hackers Immersion Program  We&#39;re really excited about this - taking our years of experience teaching kids at our schools and taking it to a wider audience.</description>

 Time to wrap up sorting for a while. We just finished quicksort having gone through a series of lessons We started with Quickselect.  Then we did a quicksort, copying to new arrays during the partition  Then finally to an in place quicksort.  
 For the final quicksort we used a partition algorithm pretty much the same as the one described here.  We started testing using by building a randomly filled array like this: Random rnd = new Random(); int a[] = new int[n]; for (int i0;i&amp;amp;lt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #7CB8BB;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;n&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;;i++) { a[i]  rnd.</description>

      <description>div.center {text-align:center;} 
 When I first saw the quicksort it was in an algorithms class back in the day. We first learned the quicksort, then choosing a good pivot element and then as an afterthought we did quickselect.  Fast forward to teaching. I was never really happy teaching quicksort. Mergesort is easy to motivate and it&#39;s pretty easy to write. Quicksort always felt a little forced.</description>

Plus ça change, plus c&#39;est la même chose 
 The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Last week we heard all about the new SAT. Going back to 1600 points, writing optional, and reworking the verbal section.  Immediate responses ranged from the usual fact that SAT doesn&#39;t correlate with college success to the idea that the motive was not to improve the test but rather to recapture market share from the ACT.</description>

 Crystal Furman wrote a nice post titled Coding Comprehension about a week ago. There was a little buzz about it in the APCS Facebook group and shortly after, Alfred Thompson added his two cents.  I thought I&#39;d add mine, at least a couple of thoughts.  There are a lot of issues - long term retention, transfer of knowledge from the basics to more advanced tools, pattern recognition, and more.</description>

      <description>I like a fairly informal atmosphere in my classes. Students have to know that there&amp;rsquo;s a line between teacher and student but I also want them to feel like we&amp;rsquo;re all part of the Stuy CS family.
Whenever we start a new term, it takes a while to break down the walls. The students don&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect of me, can they trust me? Am I a bozo? Who knows.</description>

 We&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time on State Space Search. It&amp;rsquo;s a great topic. We deal with or at least introduce:
 Recursion Blind search Heuristic search foreshadowing things like A* and Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm.  and more. Today, however. I want to talk about something else.
We started by developing a maze solver. It reads a text file representing the maze and then proceeds to find an exit.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re ramping up for recursion in my junior classes - state space search, nlg(n) sorts, etc. As a refresher, we took a quick look at the Fibonacci numbers.
Now, some people seem to think that it&amp;rsquo;s a tired problem. It&amp;rsquo;s mathy, it&amp;rsquo;s played out, it&amp;rsquo;s boring etc.. They just might be missing the point.
The beauty isn&amp;rsquo;t in the problem itself, but rather, that it&amp;rsquo;s a platform on which you can look at many problem solving techniques.</description>

      <description>I think my one regret over the years is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much travel. So, when I had the opportunity to go to the 2014 Tapia conference, I jumped at the chance. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see too much of Seattle, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve more incentive to go back.
In addition to seeing new sites, it also gave me an opportunity to see friends that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see too often.</description>

      <description>Spent the past few days at the Tapia Conference in Seattle.
The Tapia conference is billed as a &amp;ldquo;Celebration of Diversity in Computing.&amp;rdquo; The bulk of the attendees seemed to be students. Undergrads and grads. The undergrads were mostly juniors and seniors, but a bunch of freshmen and sophomores were there as well. Of course there were faculty members to join them as well as people from industry.
What was I doing there?</description>

I&amp;#39;d love to see an Intro to Linux (way more than just install) as a 3-hour workshop at #CSTA14 @csteachersa
&amp;mdash; Steve Keinath (@keinath) November 12, 2013 @alfredtwo @csteachersa Right. I know very little &amp;amp; would love a &amp;quot;zero to hero&amp;quot; Linux workshop.

I briefly considered proposing a session for the conference but it was just a day or two before the deadline, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to be able to attend the conference, and besides, who said anything I proposed would be accepted.</description>

Today, we had our first guest speaker. Davin Chew, founder and CTO of SumAll. Davin&amp;rsquo;s also a member of the StuyCS family, he was my student back in the nineties. When Davin heard we needed space for our Saturday program, he and the SumAll team graciously offered to host.</description>

      <description>This past Monday I, like may woke to hear about the passing of Pete Seeger. Ten days earlier we were up at Symphony Space for the &amp;ldquo;Woody&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rdquo; 45th Anniversary Concert. Pete was supposed to perform but was ill. At 94 years of age, I wondered if the end was near. I was at the concert with my family as well as with my buddy Ben. Fitting since Ben and I grew up on Pete&amp;rsquo;s music while many of our peers did not.</description>

      <description>Last time, I shared my thoughts on the recent coverage of AP CS statistics. Compiled and presented by Barbara Ericson and later reported on all over the place.
To summarize my point of view - yes there is a problem but some of the highlighted data points can easily be shown to be irrelevant and therefore can hurt the greater goal of access to great CS education for all.
This felt like the launching pad for a great class discussion.</description>

      <description>Some buzz seems to have circulated on the data compiled by Barbara Ericson on AP Computer Science test takers in 2013. In addition to going to the source there was a piece in The Atlantic and in Education Week.
Some exciting results:
 In two states just as many girls passed the AP CS exam as guys!!!!! In two other states, just 6 more guys passed than girls!!!!! In yet another state, 100% of the girls passed, doing far better than the approximately 75% of the boys that passed!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about That One Inspirational Curriculum - the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s not the topic in the syllabus but rather what the teacher does with it.
Some times a simple problem can lead to some really neat concepts.
Take what we did in my AP classes over the past couple of days.
I wanted a nice little warm up after the break so we wrote a simple rotation cipher. We started with a little encode routine - take a string and rotate the letters by some offset.</description>

I love a good snow day as much as the next guy, but after a big vacation, I was really ready to get back to work with the kids.
Saturday, hacking sessions were set to resume. Being in Manhattan, getting around was pretty easy but we&amp;rsquo;ve got hackers from all over the city from Staten Island to the Bronx.</description>

If I&amp;rsquo;m working on something specific, I might set a goal to finish it, but the idea of goals for a year never struck a chord with me.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I find absurd about the current teacher rating system - I have to decided on my three goals for the year. I always have one goal with respect to my profession - to be better at it.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s also time for a new look to this blog.
Why the rewrite? Partly because I was tired of the look, but mostly because, when I put it together, it was the first time I used that toolset and was just figuring things out.
I&amp;rsquo;m still no expert, but I thought it was time to clean things up.</description>

      <description>In spite of the Java based annoyances I mentioned last time, I decided to go ahead and do Radix sort with my AP students. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t cover it in AP Computer Science, but I like getting the kids to think about using arrays as buckets as it&amp;rsquo;s a new way of thinking for them and it does give a non-trivial application that combines ararys and ArrayLists.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little algorithm.</description>

      <description>Java&amp;rsquo;s never been my favorite language either for using or for teaching.
As a programmer, after starting with languages like Fortran and Pascal, I really cut my teeth with C. More recently, Python has been my go to language to get real work done.
From a teaching point of view most languages have good points and bad ones. When the AP class went from Pascal to C++ I lamented losing the simplicity and the low cost of entry.</description>

      <description>The subtitle of this post is:
 and why my students are going to hate me tomorrow.
 When my good friend Gerry Seidman talks to my classes, he frequently says &amp;ldquo;never use a data structure or algorithm you couldn&amp;rsquo;t build yourself.&amp;rdquo;
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have to write everything from scratch, just that you should have some knowledge as to what&amp;rsquo;s going on under the hood. I find that all too often young programmers just rely on APIs and libraries and really don&amp;rsquo;t know how their computers and programs are working.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with how our hackers are doing - they&amp;rsquo;re a great bunch and even if they don&amp;rsquo;t realize it yet, are making great progress.
Meanwhile, as an instructor and program designer I&amp;rsquo;m noticing the differences between a once a week program and having a class every day (note - I&amp;rsquo;m not the sole designer or instructor. I have a great team - JonAlf, Sam, and Topher are three of the best teachers I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with - this post, however, is based on my observations).</description>

      <description>Today was Halloween. This year we were the crew of the Enterprise. The original series, that is.
 
Overall, the school had a much more subdued spirit than past years but it was fun. Certainly more fun for me than the past couple of years.  For those of you that don&#39;t know - I have a long history of going all out for Halloween. Starting in October 1994 as Groo the Wanderer:</description>

      <description>The other week I was invited by Brandon Diamond and Ilana Sufrin to participate in HuffPost Labs podcast - Floating Points.  I&#39;ve known Brandon for a while and he&#39;s a really awesome guy. He&#39;s a techie for sure but he also understands the importance of community building. Brandon and Ilana (also awesome but I haven&#39;t known her as long) are at HuffPost labs and also are working on important initiatives like Hacker Union.</description>

      <description>Saturday was the second day of CSTUY&amp;rsquo;s Hacking Sessions. We started out wit a minor panic - none of the laptops could connect to the wireless!!! After a brief scramble, we finally gave up and gave our host a call (sorry Davin) and the problem was swiftly addressed. From there it was off to the races.
Last week we spent most of the session with mixers and setting up the laptops.</description>

      <description>Last week in my AP classes, we were working on inheritance.
So, what to do?
Last time around I had my classes work on a &amp;ldquo;speed dating&amp;rdquo; program - StuyDater. Back then JonAlf had his classes work on Stuyablo, that classic dungeon crawl.
I still plan on reworking the StuyDater project, but first I decided to do my take on Stuyablo. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved on it. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Stuyablo II.</description>

      <description>Earlier I wrote about the new teacher evaluation system and why a teacher such as myself might now be considered ineffective and two ineffectives in a row can cost you your job.
Well, the New York City and New York State Departments of Education are the departments that just keep on giving. Here&amp;rsquo;s the latest.
This coming Wednesday, I won&amp;rsquo;t be teaching during my usual 8:00 to 10:15 block of three AP classes.</description>

      <description>Each month, The Stuyvesant school paper - the Spectator invites a teacher to write a piece on, well, basically, whatever they want to. I did it this past month.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a reposting of the piece. The original can be found on the Spectator site.
Enjoy
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got 10 periods of class and no lunch.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got four APs.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Can I also take Great Books, Multivariate, Physics C, and Software Development?&amp;rdquo; The goal of a Stuyvesant student: take as many electives and AP classes as possible.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my 46th birthday. How did I spend it? Well, 20 &amp;ldquo;Hackers&amp;rdquo; from 9 schools, 4 student TAs and a few of us teachers gathered at SumAll to kick off CSTUY&amp;rsquo;s first weekly program - Hacking Sessions (sometimes called Hackers Sessions).
  It was the first week so it was mostly mixers, setting up machines (installing Linux on 24 laptops takes time) and going over how we&amp;rsquo;ll be communicating but I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about the weeks to come.</description>

      <description>Two days ago I asked the students, in small groups, to come up with a design to store a school (or school district) database.
Yesterday we discussed the designs.
All the students took our brand of AP Computer Science last year - a superset of the old AB curriculum and in that class they implemented a number of data structures such as binary search trees and hash tables, but they really didn&amp;rsquo;t have an opportunity to design something more comprehensive.</description>

      <description>So, we&amp;rsquo;re into the second year of my Software Development class. It&amp;rsquo;s a little different since last time, I taught many of the kids in AP. This time, they&amp;rsquo;re mostly new to me.
In AP, everything is low level. The students build linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs and the like. It&amp;rsquo;s all about building the data structure. The Node, if you would.
We&amp;rsquo;re about to start talking about databases.</description>

      <description>So here we are starting the new year and NY City is rolling out its new teacher evaluation system.
It was all over the news last year.
Ultimately, the state imposed the plan.
The city hailed the new plan as a way to fire under-performing teachers.
The UFT president hailed the plan as something that &amp;ldquo;is designed to help teachers improve their skills&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;
My take? All three parties have thrown the students and teachers under the bus.</description>

      <description>We just got back from a few days in Montreal.
Love the city - it&amp;rsquo;s walkable, lots of good food, love the waterfront, history, and lots to do.
I also love seeing a city using a bike/walking combo. In a car, you speed by things too fast and parking&amp;rsquo;s always a problem. Foot alone doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you cover enough ground. By bike, you&amp;rsquo;re slow enough to see things but fast enough to get from place to place.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of people talk about curriculum.
&amp;ldquo;We need a curriculum that works for everyone.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;If we had a good curriculum, we could get CS in the schools.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you just take someone else&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and scale things out?&amp;rdquo;
People miss the point. In my twenty some odd years as an educator and my forty five as a human (including 18 as a parent), I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard someone talk about that one inspirational curriculum that made all the difference in their lives.</description>

      <description>So, the Citibike program has been running for a bit. I like the idea, but I have some reservations &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s great for getting around in the zone - I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for short shopping trips - run cross town to Fairway or take a quick trip from work to Porto Rico Importers or Rocco&amp;rsquo;s Pastries. On the other hand, the zone doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to the residential neighborhoods of upper Manhattan or the boroughs and the price per day is way too expensive for regular working class joes, particularly on top of a subway trip.</description>

      <description>For those of that don&amp;rsquo;t know, the New York Tech Meetup it&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that help make the New York Tech Scene so awesome.
It&amp;rsquo;s a group of some 30k+ members and once a month, at Skriball Center at NYU they hold a meetup. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite an event. Members of the tech community demo their projects, there&amp;rsquo;s question and answer time, and afterwards theres a gathering for schmoozing amongst the crowd and the presenters.</description>

      <description>People keep asking me about how we&amp;rsquo;re doing with respect to gender balance and CS education at Stuy.
Rather than writing the same email again and again, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d summarize things here.
We&amp;rsquo;ve done rather well at Stuy. I might write more in depth at some point in the future but we don&amp;rsquo;t dumb anything down and we aren&amp;rsquo;t patronizing. I think much of the success can be attributed to:</description>

      <description>One week ago today was Stuyvesant&#39;s graduation.  I usually know a number of seniors pretty well but, since I like to cycle through classes, every couple of years I have a group that I&#39;ve been with from 10th grade to 12th.  This was one of those years  It was extra special because it was also my daughter Batya&#39;s graduating class.  It&#39;s been an amazing gift to be able to work at her school for the past four years and she&#39;s been amazingly tolerant.</description>

      <description>This past year, I was able to convince my administration to allow me to create a new course - Software Development. I really felt there was something missing in our kids CS preparation - missing both from Stuy&amp;rsquo;s program and from many youngsters college experiences.
I plan to do a few posts on the course, it&amp;rsquo;s design, implementation, and lessons learned, but for today, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the years culminating event:</description>

      <description>About a month ago, I talked about using real data with our intro classes. After looking at the correlation between school&amp;rsquo;s SAT scores and free and reduced lunch rates, it was time to turn the students loose.
The assignment: Find some interesting data out and do something with it. Make a web page that shows what you did and what you discoverde. We had already looked at the NYC Data Mine as well as a few other sources but students were encouraged to find new data sourcess.</description>

      <description>The Problem: The buzz word is &amp;ldquo;accountability.&amp;rdquo; Why are teachers special? Why don&amp;rsquo;t they feel they need to be evaluated like other professionals? Why do they feel they need a &amp;ldquo;job for life?&amp;rdquo;
Of course, the job for life line is nonsense &amp;ndash; teachers have tenure, but that&amp;rsquo;s just due process - not a guarantee of a job.
Friends in the private sector ask &amp;ldquo;if a teacher is doing a good job, why do they need tenure?</description>

      <description>Earlier in the term, our intro classes spent a little time learning some basic HTML. We don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time on it, just enough so that the students can present their work in a static web site. The end goal, though, was to programatically generate the web sites - there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite as empowering to a student as when they can present their work to the world.
Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s all coming together.</description>

      <description>When looking for assignments for our classes, in addition to trying to craft assignments that develop and reinforce key ideas, we also strive to come up with ideas that &amp;ldquo;speak&amp;rdquo; to the students and keep their interest. We write small games, use problems within the student&amp;rsquo;s experiences, and in general try to find problems that are appealing.
This is much easier to do when the kids can read data from a file.</description>

A young lady in my intro class found me in my office near the end of the day:
 Student: Mr. Z, I wanted to make sure to catch you before vacation!
Me: What&amp;rsquo;s up?
Student: I wanted to tell you that today&amp;rsquo;s lesson was AWESOME!!!!!!
 Wow. I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching 23 years and that&amp;rsquo;s never happened before!</description>

      <description>Today I had the privilege of attending my second live State of the City address. Mayor Bloomberg didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much time on education as he did at last year&amp;rsquo;s address but he did take a moment to give a shout out to charter schools. It gets old hearing the same false story about how charters are better than public schools. At least we have people like Gary Rubinstein and Diane Ravitch trying to set the record straight.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the likes of Jon Simantov and David Lerner as well as the greater Stuy CS family, a few of us have been working on CSTUY, Computer Science and Technology for Urban Youth. Yeah, we backed into the acronym. Let&#39;s bring Stuy CS out of Stuy so we can work on inspiring a wider range of students.  Well, last Wednesday we had our inaugural event. Hosted by NY TechStars (thanks Moisey), we invited 75 youngsters to an evening of talks.</description>

That came up this morning so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share.
I recently posted about the in-term projects my Software Development kids were working on. Well, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to grade their final projects.
The code is up on GitHub. This morning I was faced with independently going to every project page and cloning each one:</description>

The most rewarding part of my job involves the relationships I&amp;rsquo;ve developed over the years but is was always between me and my alums and them to their classmates. This was an attempt to start building a network that spanned the years.</description>

      <description>My last post I was talking about the fact that as teachers, our knowledge and experience is frequently trivialized. The tenor of the times is that anyone can design a course, anyone can teach, and in fact, we don&#39;t even need teachers, just videos or computer based systems. If you&#39;ve ever tutored a friend, you&#39;re more than qualified.
 That might be a strong statement but everywhere you look you see &#34;</description>

      <description>So, it&#39;s Computer Science Education Week. Full of rah rah events and everyone&#39;s gung ho about teaching computer science.
 You all know that CS Ed is what I&#39;ve dedicated most of my life to and maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m &#34;not feeling it&#34; in terms of CS Ed Week. Let me explain.
 Yesterday there was a Twitter Conversation led by a &#34;national panel of thought leaders in the field.</description>

      <description>This post was supposed to be about varsity academic teams but I wanted to share something else first.
 For years I was unhappy with our &#34;research&#34; course but due to the misguided views of our past administration, I pretty much had to keep it running. Over the same time, I was frustrated by the fact that there was so much missing in our students computer science related education. Specifically, kids don&#39;t really get to experience creating large &#34;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we&amp;rsquo;re governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you&amp;rsquo;re not in the top &amp;ldquo;n,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re out. So, if our basketball team has, let&amp;rsquo;s say 15 kids on it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of the team.</description>

      <description>The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301.
This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class reunions. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been invited to a handful of reunions and really consider it an honor when I am.</description>

      <description>On going back to work today Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class yesterday. At the end of the session, which I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize below, I told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the weekend. One student queried &amp;ldquo;you mean no class on Friday :-(?&amp;rdquo; Alas no &amp;ndash; while students aren&amp;rsquo;t reporting to school this morning, teachers are.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.

The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it&#39;s as good a time as any to try to resurrect this blog.  As you can see, I&#39;ve moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted on Github. I&#39;m really liking the way it works but more on that at a later date.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the weak title and movie reference.
It&#39;s teacher appreciation week -- one of our lesser celebrated weeks. I&#39;m waiting for the annual letter we get from the chancellor. Given the level of teacher bashing over the last few years, I&#39;ve recently found their emails amusing.
I though I&#39;d take the time to thank a few of my most influential teachers. To paraphrase: whatever good I&#39;ve been able to do, it has been because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.</description>

      <description>Shortly after our event at Foursquare, I was chatting with Kevin Friedman (Stuy &#39;96). Kevin&#39;s startup is Cojourneo&amp;nbsp;and since it has an educational bent, he thought I might be interested in hearing about it.
I certainly was.
Rather than visiting Kevin, I thought it would be fun to have him come down after school, present Cojourneo to any students that wanted to stay late and then field questions.
Cojourneo is an interesting product.</description>

      <description>Anyone can cook - Chef GusteauThese days the rage seems anyone can code.
On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.
We&#39;ve got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth &#34;learn to code&#34; efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.
While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts.</description>

      <description>&#34;...&amp;nbsp;the standardized courses don&#39;t shed much light on future opportunities and they make it hard for students to identify what they&#39;re most interested in. The CS department, on the other hand, is great at demonstrating all the things that are going on in the modern comp sci world.&#34;&amp;nbsp;-- Asa, one of our current CS students.Asa&#39;s comment was in response to an event we held last Tuesday. We brought 100 current students up to FourSquare&amp;nbsp;along with 100 of our CS alums for a mixer.</description>

      <description>When kids are knee deep in nlog(n) algorithms and working on recursion, it&#39;s easy to lose track of the amazingly neat things that are right around the corner for them.
I&#39;ve recently been working on organizing our Stuyvesant Computer Science alumni network and am putting together a page with some of the places our graduates work&amp;nbsp;here.
It can be hard to see how one goes from sorting and searching in Java to working at places like Google, or FourSqurare or creating your own startup like DigitalOcean, Usable Health,&amp;nbsp;TimeHop, or PropHop.</description>

Instead of having a typical lab type periods, we tried the Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout.
We aren&#39;t annualized so while the kids that have been with me since September have been working in pairs for a while, the other half of the class is just getting used to how we do it. I also wanted to get the kids to mix a little more.</description>

      <description>Piloting a new course this semester - Intro to Computer Science part 2. Between the existing Intro part 1 and this, we should be able to do a pretty thorough job in preparing our kids for the future.
We decided that we wanted the kids to make deliverables in the form of web pages - plain old html written by hand. Part of the idea was to demystify things, part was to let the kids show off their work, part was to have something that they can generate programatically as the course progressed, and part was to give them a tool they might find valuable beyond their computer science classes.</description>

End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.
It&#39;s going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I&#39;d put up this short semi-related post.</description>

      <description>Fred Wilson and me at #SOTC2012Last week I was given the honor of attending the State of the City address. The mayor was announcing a new school for the fall. An Academy for Software Engineering. This has been in the works for a while and has a long way to go but the announcement was a major step. The project really got its start a couple of years ago. I&#39;d been working hard for years prior trying to get the city to help me grow the program I developed at Stuyvesant, but until Fred got involved, there was no movement.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve always lamented the fact that we don&#39;t have the time or structure to really teach our kids to program.
In their early classes, they learn syntax, algorithms, and &amp;nbsp;some ways of storing data and while they &amp;nbsp;will probably work on some larger projects as they study CS, kids seem to be mostly left on their own in terms of how to take a project from problem or idea to completion.</description>

      <description>Now that the ML and AI courses are at an end, here are some of the things I would do moving forward.
Both courses already have a basic track where students just watch the lectures and do the in lecture quizzes and an advanced track where students also complete weekly assignments. I think we can be certain that there were students who just watched a few lectures, many who completed every assignment, and those who fell at all points in between.</description>

We&#39;re always looking for interesting applications to build lessons around. Over the years, I&#39;ve tried different things when teaching 2 dimensional arrays. Simple game boards, representing a crossword puzzle, tables of various sorts, etc.
This year,&amp;nbsp;JonAlf, one of my amazingly talented colleagues,&amp;nbsp;decided to go with building a word search. I decided to steal the idea. It&#39;s a great one.

Rome to Little Falls
We had some trouble getting out of Rome. As always, once we&#39;re on trail, it&#39;s pretty easy to follow, but entering and leaving towns and cities, with the exceptions of canal side towns like Lockport, can be a challenge. During the day, we found that we could either follow the official Erie Canal Trail signs or the pink trail blazes painted on the streets for the Erie Canal Tour (that preceded us by a week).</description>

      <description>Today figured to be one of our longer days mileage wise, we didn&#39;t think it would be that tough or tricky to navigate.
We checked out of our hotel at about 8:30 and hit the road. Streets through Syracuse, up a few hills towards the outskirts of town. Our directions and actual streets didn&#39;t quite jive so we had a little trouble finding our way back to the canal path, but once we did we figured it would be smooth sailing.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we left Seneca Falls and headed back north up to Syracuse. Our fifth day in a row of riding. Figured it could be one of the tougher days between the changing terrain and the return of the heat and humidity.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, there&#39;s no shade in northern NY.
Turned out to be true. The first part of the ride was mostly on road. Easy surface, but up and down.&amp;nbsp; When we got to the old canal path, it was more gravely than crushed stone.</description>

&amp;nbsp;the last time we had a troubled person on that bridge. He even earned his wings.

      <description>Beautiful weather today, just like yesterday. Forgot to mention yesterday that Clarence Birdseye started his quick freezing experiments in Brockport.
Let&#39;s start with the requisite canal pics:

And a picture of my trusty steed:

We originally figured we&#39;d get lunch at Rochester -- about 18 miles into the ride. If we felt good, we&#39;d try to push on to Pittsford. We were pretty excited when we saw:</description>

      <description>Day 3. From Lockport to Brockport.
Lockport is &#34;famous&#34; for it&#39;s locks -- the two channel 5 step ones. Brockport is famous for it&#39;s... brocks?
After a reasonable nights sleep and breakfast at Hambleton House, our BnB, we were off.

&amp;nbsp;Here&#39;s one of the many lift bridges that cross the canal. Right now it&#39;s down. It&#39;s raised when a boat has to pass under. Back in the day, as there was much less road traffic, the bridges stayed in the raised position so boats and barges could pass.</description>

      <description>Surpassing our day 1 total of 1 mile wasn&#39;t going to be hard. We set out for breakfast. Rode down by the Niagara River and over the Rainbow Bridge. I was a little surprised not to find Asgard on the other side.
Back in New York, we continued on. Our first stretch was on Bike Route 5:

Paved but cragly and full of holes. Not very scenic either, at least not until we got closer to Tonowanda where we found the Seabee&#39;s memorial:</description>

      <description>Yesterday we started on a 12 day adventure. From Niagara Falls, Ont to Albany, mostly along the Erie Canal Tow path all by bike. A little more ambitious than our four day excursion outside of Pittsburgh last year.
Bright and early we set out -- at Penn Station by 6:00am. That&#39;s where we had our first scare -- the Amtrak agent said we couldn&#39;t bring out bikes. Amtrak policy say&#39;s otherwise (folding bikes that fold to within a certain size are allowed at any time according to their on line regulations.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;Been a while since my last post but summer&#39;s coming so I think I&#39;ll have more time and energy. For today, a break from CS and Education issues and something on one of my other passions, bicycling.
Having not gone on a substantial ride for a while, yesterday, we decided to do a modified circumnavigation of NYC. Starting from home, we rode east over to first avenue. From there North...</description>

      <description>I made chapati the other day. Based on a couple of recipe requests and the fact that this blog has been dormant for a while, I thought I&#39;d post the recipe here.
&amp;nbsp;To start -- Chapati is an Indian flatbread. I guess what I made is technically Pulka but it&#39;s really easy to make and quite tasty.
Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour1 cup water1 tsp saltMix all the ingredients together to form a dough.</description>

      <description>Sorting from the top and from the bottom I&#39;ve been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks, but some times life just gets in the way. I&#39;ve always thought it important to arm students with as many different tools with which to attack problems as possible. As such, the courses I teach use a number of different languages, each highlighting a different paradigm and thought process. The hope is that by the end of the sequence, they can look at problems from many different angles.</description>

      <description>Just a short follow up on the last post.
In thinking about how I frequently programs, once I have a plan, I work on one part of the project, and then ask myself &#34;what&#39;s next?&#34; That is, what is the next step towards completion.
It reminded me about a guest speaker we had a about a year and a half ago at one of our &#34;professional development&#34; days. For the past two years, our school has had &#34;</description>

      <description>One evening, many years ago, when I was in college, I had an epiphany. Maybe not as enlightening as the epiphany I had while watching &#34;The Mummy Returns&#34;&amp;nbsp; many years later, but that&#39;s a story for another day.
While working on some class project, I realized that soon, within a couple of&amp;nbsp; years, I&#39;d be working for a real company and I&#39;d actually have to write code that REALLY works. Not just something that gets past the grader, or answers all the test cases.</description>

      <description>Starting the new semester tomorrow and I&#39;ve got a whole bunch of interesting topics to blog about. Some about pedagogy, some technical, and some that I can&#39;t really catagorize.
For now, though, just a brief follow up on using Subversion for homework collection.
The basic model used in New York City for teacher improvement and evaluation is the official &#34;observation.&#34; Either your supervisor or the principal sits in on one of your classes.</description>

      <description>Ok, not subversion, rather subversion, the version control system.
I&#39;ve used subversion as a way for students to hand in their projects for years. I haven&#39;t used it with my intro classes as I think the learning curve is a little steep and the benefits few, but for A.P. and beyond (juniors and seniors) it&#39;s worked very well as a method of collection and I think it&#39;s good to get the kids in the habit of using versioning systems.</description>

      <description>That&#39;s me with my trusty Bike Friday New World Tourist. Love the bike. Love riding. It&#39;s the fastest, most pleasant way to get around the city. My commute by bike, door to door is 12 minutes. Subway is 20 - 25. Walking about 45. One certainly can&#39;t let winter weather get in the way. 
I&#39;ve got the body covered with my Assos Fugu jacket. With just a cheap long sleeve duofold shirt it&#39;s great to about 16 degrees.</description>

      <description>Closed out last week teaching the Towers of Hanoi. It&#39;s a wonderful topic. Not because it&#39;s so interesting in and of itself, but as a platform from which you can explore any number of interesting topics.
Many books appropriate for the AP (AB) curriculum mention the towers, but to my knowledge most only scratch the surface. I randomly grabbed two books that I consider good from the shelf before writing this.</description>

I showed this to Devorah last night and she immediately said &#34;Hey, that&#39;s the metal filing guy!!!&#34; Yes, you got it -- Wooly Willy!!! Everybody&#39;s favorite party toy.
Why did this come up? Well, yesterday, Rick put this together at work. So much for any productivity after that.
It&#39;s amazing all the time sinks you can throw together with just a few lines of code and NetLogo.</description>

      <description>During my first few years teaching computer science, I frequently felt isolated. As pretty much the only CS guy I really didn&#39;t have any one to &#34;talk shop&#34; with. It&#39;s hard to bounce pedagogical ideas off of your colleagues when they teach subjects that are tangentially related, at best. I now consider myself extremely fortunate that I have four terrific friends and colleagues teaching CS with me. Now we have the same advantage that other teachers have enjoyed for years.</description>

      <description>First day back after a break is always hard. By the last day of vacation, I&#39;m actually sleeping a little later and shifting the body clock back is rather harsh. It&#39;s tough enough getting started again, but it&#39;s even worse when you&#39;re thrown a curve ball. I got in at my usual 7:00, made my coffee, and started getting my lessons ready for the day. At about 7:30 we lost power in half of the room.</description>

      <description>For the winter break, I assigned this set of A exam questions (actually, just the three that don&#39;t deal with the case study) to my AP classes. I wanted to assign something that wasn&#39;t particularly heavy but I didn&#39;t want my students to forget everything over break. As with most AP exam questions, they&#39;re long, wordy, and somewhat brain dead. They take a long time to read, but they frequently take you step by step through what they want you to do.</description>

      <description>Over the past twenty years or so, I&#39;ve mulled, discussed, and argued various aspects of education, computer science, and of course computer science education with friends, students, and colleagues.
This past summer, I had the privilege to get to meet and briefly work with comp sci educators from around the country and started to thing that there were other like minded people, but we didn&#39;t have a forum with which to communicate.</description>

One of the primary reasons was that I got fed up with managing a Ruby development environment across all my machines. In spite of my rantings, I&#39;m sure Ruby and Ruby installs are fine - it&#39;s just something that I&#39;d have to deal with on a recurring basis for one specific task - other than for Jekyll blogging, I don&#39;t use Ruby.</description>
