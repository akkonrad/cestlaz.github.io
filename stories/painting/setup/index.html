Living in Manhattan doesn&#39;t allow for a lot of space. I live in a
reasonably sized (for Manhattan standards) apartment with  my wife and
son. My daughter doesn&#39;t live with us but she comes down most every
day and works out of her old room as a change of pace rather than
staying in her apartment and working alone. That leaves us with 4
people sharing space. 
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s no room for a real studio as space is at a premium but if you
want to paint regularly you don&#39;t want to spend 30 minutes doing set
up and tear down. I had a french style easel from when I was Bob Ross
for Halloween 
</p>
<img width="20%" 
src="https://media.jacksonsart.com/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/j/ej014.jpg">
<p>
and it worked well for that with the storage drawer and extending legs
but at home, not so much. The telescoping legs that set to a triangle
made for a much larger footprint than was necessary. After deciding I
was going to stick with this a while, I ended up getting this:
</p>
<img width="35%" src="/painting/easel.jpg">
<p>
It seems bigger but the footprint is smaller. 
</p>
<p>
I got this branded as a DaVinci easel but there are a bunch out
there. I like the shelf on the bottom and I got a couple of hanging
baskets to attach to the back to hold paintbrushes which a keep in
used tomato cans that I&#39;ve washed out. : 
</p>
<img width="35%" src="/painting/easel-back.jpg">
<p>
I throw a cheap plastic tablecloth over the dining table behind the
easel and that&#39;s where I put my equipment when I work.
</p>
<img width="35%" src="/painting/easel-table.jpg">
<p>
I also needed a place to store paintings while they dried. For that I
got this rack: 
</p>
<img width="35%" src="/painting/rack.jpg"> It seems bigger but the footprint is smaller
<p>
I got my easel and rack at Jerry&#39;s Artorama. I&#39;ll write about them in
the supplies post. I also got a couple of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Vinyl-Hard-Floor-Chair/dp/B07PGN63W5/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_0_1/134-3759504-0733668?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07PGN63W5&amp;pd_rd_r=4c9e6ee5-bea1-4ebb-a592-c11211d857c6&amp;pd_rd_w=TzX8g&amp;pd_rd_wg=fSfwy&amp;pf_rd_p=78d6a3dc-d4af-46b9-998e-003981a80dbb&amp;pf_rd_r=G7TQDYGSZYJKX4A453HH&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=G7TQDYGSZYJKX4A453HH">floor mats</a> and that&#39;s pretty
much it. 
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for the setup. 
</p>
<p>
The easel&#39;s always out and I try to keep a prepped canvas either on
the easel or on my rack so setup is a breeze.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Put the tablecloth over the table
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Grab a disposable pallet pad and add paints
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fill my brush cleaning bucket with water (since I&#39;m using water
mixable paints) and pull out the trash can / beater rack
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
and I&#39;m ready to go. Just takes a minute or two.
</p>
<p>
Cleanup is also pretty quick: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Throw out the paper pallete
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Wash the brushes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Remove the tablecloth and throw behind the easel. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Takes about 3 or 4 minutes plus the brush cleaning time. 
</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s my setup. Let me know if I should continue this series when
I&#39;ll talk about my experience with water mixable paints, brushes adn
the rest.
