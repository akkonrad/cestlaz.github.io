Hi fellow painters. Okay, I&#39;m not a painter, I&#39;m a Computer Science
teacher in NYC. I thought I&#39;d take up Bob Ross style wet on wet
painting and thought that others might benefit from hearing about
what I&#39;ve learned so far in my journey.</p>
<p>
Since Covid, like many people I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time at
home and most of my day is facing a computer screen. Work? On
screen. Watching TV or videos? On screen. Even reading a book is more
often than not, on a screen. I had some painting equipment from around
twenty years ago when I went to work as Bob Ross for Halloween but
never really painted. I figured now would be a good time to try it for
real. </p>
<p>
Of course, there were some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I live in a NYC Apartment so with my family so space is an issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So are concerns over fumes and hazardous materials - using, storing,
and disposing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost is always an issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, did I mention, in NYC space is always an issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these pages, I&#39;ll talk about what I&#39;ve used, what&#39;s worked for me,
what I&#39;ve learned and hopefully others can benefit. I&#39;ll start with
talking about my setup and how I&#39;m coping with painting in a small
apartment. If people find it useful, I&#39;ll follow with the other topics
that are listed as coming soon.</p>
