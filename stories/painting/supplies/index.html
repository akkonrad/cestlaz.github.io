Alas that magical store is long gone so what to do? 
</p>
<p>
It seems that most of the instructional videos I find on YouTube have
links to supplies but they&#39;re all to Amazon and, all things being
equal, I&#39;d just as soon give someone else my business. On the other
hand, I&#39;m not in a financial place that I want to pay a huge premium
out of principal.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I&#39;ve found two great supplies.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.jerrysartarama.com/">Jerry&#39;s Artorama</a> and <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/">Blick</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Both have huge inventories, mostly overlapping but not quite the
same. Both also seem to have an eternal sale going on. Navigation of
both sites takes getting used to but they both operate the same.
</p>
<p>
Both seem to have very competitive prices. 
</p>
<p>
Jerry&#39;s has free shipping on orders over $45 and I generally get my
stuff in a couple of days. Blick seems to take longer and while there
frequently seems to be a free shipping discount code for orders over
$45 I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s always there.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I get a teacher&#39;s discount at Blick and there are
multiple brick and mortar Blick stores near my apartment so I can
support a local store and get things right away.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll also sometimes use Michael&#39;s for Canvases but I&#39;ll talk about
that in the canvas post.
</p>
<p>
While neither of these are small businesses, both grew out of small
local businesses so I&#39;d rather patronize them than Amazon. If I&#39;m
missing any other great suppliers, please let me know.
