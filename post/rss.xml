      <title>Getting the word out on Hunter CS in 2020</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/recruiting-2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As we move through Fall, I&amp;#39;m missing one of the most draining but at
the same time one of my favorite parts of the year. School recruiting
visits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I came to Hunter, I started the Daedalus CS Honors program. We
started small but now, each year, we take in about fifty students,
give them a laptop and a scholarship and all sorts of extras and bring
them in for a great CS education at a fraction of the cost of say NYU
or Columbia. It is without a doubt the best value CS education, I&amp;#39;d
say, maybe anywhere. The trouble is, we&amp;#39;re still not that well known -
reputations in the school game take decades to establish and as Hunter
is still mostly known as a liberal arts / nursing school getting the
word out and building trust with students and teachers can be a chore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the past four years I&amp;#39;ve spent the Fall visiting schools. Pretty
much anyone who&amp;#39;d have me as long as they have students who could be
interested in CS. I&amp;#39;d trek out in the early morning on the subway to
all manner of neighborhoods and talk to students. I&amp;#39;d hate the early
morning travel and the long subway rides but whenever I&amp;#39;d get
somewhere I would stroll around a new or different
neighborhood. Afterwards, on my way back I could stop at local
shops. The challenge became finding some local food seller, usually a
bakery and get something that you can&amp;#39;t get in Chelsea or the Upper
Easts Side. I&amp;#39;d also get to visit all manner of schools - many built
under the WPA and many with walls of fame and other interesting
architecture, features and history. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, the real highlight was talking to students, teachers,
guidance counselors. Sometimes, I&amp;#39;d address an entire senior class -
this is my favorite format - I get to talk to the CS and the non CS
students - makes for a much better diversity push. That was usually
followed by small group discussions with interested students. I&amp;#39;d also
sometimes talk with one or more individual classes. Some visits though
get a bit crazy like visiting large schools with large CS programs
where I&amp;#39;m bouncing from class to class all day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been told that my talks have been valuable - while I talk about
Daedalus and Hunter at the end, the talk is really about questions you
should ask when considering a college and considering a major with an
emphasis on CS. My theory is that I&amp;#39;m not trying to con anyone into
coming to Hunter. I&amp;#39;ve built a great program and Hunter / Hunter CS is strong
and affordable. I want to help the right fit students come to that
realization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, now I can&amp;#39;t do school visits so what to do? Zoom visits? I
don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll come across as well but probably better than
nothing. In school? Should I set up evening sessions? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not skilled at making fancy video presentations and I don&amp;#39;t have
the charisma to just make a simple video that&amp;#39;ll have the desired
effect so I&amp;#39;m really struggling with this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, any ideas out there? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s the best way for me to connect with good fits for Hunter CS?
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deadlines And Commitments</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/deadlines-and-commitments/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:50:38 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/deadlines-and-commitments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A few days ago I was part of a Twitter discussion on assignment
deadlines. I noticed a tweet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Not sure who needs to hear this, but stop taking off points for late assignments. It’s not helping students learn responsibility, and it’s not making your job easier. It’s only making your class inequitable. 💯&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sydney Jensen (@sydneycjensen) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sydneycjensen/status/1309946435056611335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I disagreed. I wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily against floating or open deadlines
without deductions but rather, they made my life more difficult and
weren&amp;#39;t in the best interest of my students. That said, they could
very well be appropriate for Sydney and her&amp;#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I saw some emails on the SIGCSE list on the same topic. One
caught my eye - the poster talked about giving extra credit for early
submissions. These were likely unrelated discussions since the twitter
participants were not CS educators and I think the SIGCSE discussion
was mostly of college level CS instructors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any event, it was a sign. I was meant to write a blog post on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, what&amp;#39;s my policy?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For homework or small every day assignments I grade for attempt, not
correctness. You either made an honest effort or you didn&amp;#39;t. I
encourage students to help each other but ask they cite where and when
they got help. When all is said and done, if you&amp;#39;ve done most of the
homework you get the full homework percent of the grade. If you miss
one here or there, no big deal. If you miss a whole bunch, you&amp;#39;ve got
a problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For projects, I have hard deadlines with a deduction for lateness. If
time and circumstance permits, I&amp;#39;ll give a project and we&amp;#39;ll have a
discussion and set the due date together. Also, if a student talks to
me ahead of time about some issue, I&amp;#39;ll almost always give a penalty
free extension. On the other hand, if they come to me last minute, I
usually won&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I grade, and I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; grading, I get into a groove so grading a
project later does inconvenience me and it&amp;#39;s also not doing the
student any favors - we&amp;#39;ve moved on to the next set of topics but I
don&amp;#39;t have the project which is an assessment of how the student was
doing up to that point.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Is this bad? I don&amp;#39;t think so. While many deadlines are arbitrary,
students do have to learn to get things done and as long as the
deadline is reasonable there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem. Since I&amp;#39;m
flexible if a student has a particular issue even more so. One
tweet on the thread said that since some students aren&amp;#39;t comfortable
asking a teacher for an extension it was unfair but I think you have
to draw the line somewhere. One students might not ask for an
extension and just be late and another might not ask and kill
themselves to meet the deadline but in either case, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s
unreasonable to expect the student to advocate for themselves
particularly when they can start the conversation either in person or
via email and in private. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, is having open deadlines all good? Probably
not. Some students will game and abuse the system. Not all, but
certainly some and those students will gain an advantage in terms of
grades. Now, in an ideal world. we wouldn&amp;#39;t care about grades but in
the current reality if student one gets a fair B+ while student two
exploits loose deadlines nad gets an A-, guess who&amp;#39;s more likely to
get into that selective college? There&amp;#39;s also the problem of
snowballing and falling behind. If a student is a week late on
something that reinforces or clarifies the next topic that student is
now falling behind on that next topic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also have the final looming deadline of end of semester or end of
year which further complicates matters. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, who&amp;#39;s right? Who knows. Overall, I think what I do works for me
and my classes. It&amp;#39;s a system that&amp;#39;s evolved over three decades and
will continue to evolve. Every year is a potential tweak and every new
situation, like when I came over to Hunter was cause for
re-evaluation. On the other hand, I know teachers who have open
deadlines and it seems to work for them and their students so they
should keep on keeping on. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about that extra credit for early projects? This is one that
sounds good but I don&amp;#39;t like it. I think this one is potentially
really inequitable. It sounds good until you remember that students
all have different schedules and different obligations. If you give
students one week to complete an assignment starting monday, even if
they all have roughly the same workload, it will be distributed in
different ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One kid might front load their courses into Mon-Wed so they don&amp;#39;t have
to commute Thursday and Friday. That student will never be able to
finish an assignment early because they&amp;#39;ve left there homework time
for later in the week. Same thing for a kid who works evenings rather
than weekends. There will be other kids where their schedule favors
finishing early. This sounds like a great idea but it will really only
favor a select few and not necessarily because they&amp;#39;re doing things
&amp;#34;the right way.&amp;#34; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the answer on due dates? As usual we get a resouding &amp;#34;it
depends.&amp;#34; I just gave an assignment last Monday and over Zulip we
collectively decided that a fair deadline would be a week from
today. I don&amp;#39;t expect any extensions will be needed but if I&amp;#39;m
approached I&amp;#39;ll probably be flexible as I&amp;#39;ve always been. My policy
seems to be working well so I&amp;#39;m sticking to it for now. If yours works
for you, do the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Emacs 75 - Bufler</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-75-bufler/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:17:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-75-bufler/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Quick Emacs hit today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After my last video, I received a comment noting that I was using
ibuffer and that there was another package I might want to consider -
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el&#34;&gt;bufler&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started with basic ibuffer and then started to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/&#34;&gt;customize it&lt;/a&gt; to group
buffers but that was always somewhat finicky. More often than not I
couldn&amp;#39;t tune it the way I wanted. Most recently, I started using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-projectile&#34;&gt;ibuffer-projectile&lt;/a&gt; which group projects for me but lost the other
customizations. In any event, I was more or less happy with things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el&#34;&gt;Bufler&lt;/a&gt; though looks to be a nice alternative. Out of the box it looks
like it groups things pretty well and has a nice Emacs &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra&#34;&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; that you
can bring up with &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to remind you how to do things like kill one or
more buffers.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Right now, I&amp;#39;m using it as an ibuffer replacement but it also has its
own version of switch buffer that I plan to play with as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only knit I&amp;#39;ve found thus far is that when you run bufler, it
splits the window and lists the buffers in the new space. If I&amp;#39;m using
ibuffer I want it to use the whole Emacs frame. Otherwise I just use
ivy-switch-buffer (or now bufler-switch-buffer). I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out
a way built in so ended up writing a small function: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-lisp&#34; data-lang=&#34;lisp&#34;&gt;(defun mz/bufler-one-window (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;optional&lt;/span&gt; force-refresh)
  (interactive &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;P&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (bufler-list)
  (delete-other-windows)

)

(global-set-key (kbd &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;C-x C-b&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;mz/bufler-one-window&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video for more details.

      <title>Zulip - maybe the answer for class communication</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/zulip/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:01:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/zulip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s always been a challenge to get students to buy in to an out of
class communication tool. Over the years I&amp;#39;ve tried many including
mailing lists, Piazza, Discourse, Vanilla and other discussion forums,
Slack and probably a few other things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it&amp;#39;s not surprising that it&amp;#39;s a hard sell - prior to the
internet once school was out kids there as no teacher student
interaction until the next school day and kids would only interact
with their direct friends. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, we have technology and even without great buy in, if nothing
else there&amp;#39;s an advantage to having an electronic means of
distributing things to students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately I fell back on a plain old mailing list. Discussion/forum
platforms didn&amp;#39;t work for me because it was yet another location that
you had to remember to check. Slack didn&amp;#39;t work because at its core
it&amp;#39;s for live chat and while workers are at their desks all day and
can have a chat open, that doesn&amp;#39;t work with students and catching up
on a complex Slack with threads after the fact is, well, just no. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With us going remote in Coronatime needs changed. Slack looked like it
might be more viable. It still had the problem of limited threads but
in addition to students being more &amp;#34;always on,&amp;#34; for better or worse,
live remote teaching benefits form a chat. Why Slack over the built in
Zoom chat? Well, one thing is that the Zoom chat disappears after the
session whereas Slack lives on and can form the base for ongoing
discussion. Second, dedicated chat platforms like Slack are more
robust and featureful.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the summer and into this semester, Slack seems to be working very
well for my teacher certification candidates but I ended up using
something else - &lt;a href=&#34;https://zulip.com&#34;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; for my undergraduate classes and plan to move
my teachers over to it for the next cohort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why the change? Both Zulip and Slack have free tiers but Zulip can
also be self hosted and is open source. Slack is slicker when it comes
to integrations but Zulip is the clear winner for combined sync and
async conversations due to its threading model combined with flexible
alerts. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put together this short video showing  the basics - check it out:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWa56KdgYZM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can use Zulip free on their site with similar limits as for
Slack&amp;#39;s free tier or you can self host. I&amp;#39;m running our Zulip
instances on a Digital Ocean droplet. DO has a &amp;#34;one click&amp;#34; Zulip setup
that was fairly straightforward. You might want to check that out if
you&amp;#39;re comfortable as a Linux admin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far, I&amp;#39;m liking Zulip very much and thing I&amp;#39;ll be using it as my
primary in and out of class communication tool. I&amp;#39;d like a better
selection of emoji and wish it was easier to both use integrations and
write bots but the thread based interface is really great. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know Slack&amp;#39;s the big name and I do like Slack as well but if you&amp;#39;re
a teacher and looking for an in and out of class chat/communication
platform check Zulip out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>School leadership and COVID, or not</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:48:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/covid-leadership/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Teachers are back and students will soon follow either in person or
remote. In person means in person one or two days a week with the
rest of the time from home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This of course shows horrible leadership. It fails in terms of
education, safety and even freeing up parents to get back to
work. After all, if your kid is only in school one or two days a week
it hardly allows you to get back to your own full time job. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course the plan gets worse. It&amp;#39;s optimized to provide the worst
possible educational experience. I won&amp;#39;t rehash the plans here but
it&amp;#39;s looking to increase the teachers workload tremendously while at
the same time killing continuity for the students (unless of course
the DOE can hire thousands of extra teachers and somehow arrange for
them to mind meld with the  main teacher). I&amp;#39;m not going to hash out
the details here but they&amp;#39;re easy enough to find on the interwebs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now in terms of leadership I&amp;#39;m not writing about De Blasio or
Carranza. We all know they&amp;#39;re absolutely horrible. It&amp;#39;s hard to
believe Carranza was actually a classroom teacher at one point and
while I&amp;#39;m no fan of Bloomberg on education at least you could say that
he had a vision, albeit an incorrect one of applying business sense to
schools and followed it while De Blasio is tone deaf, arrogant and
clueless which could make him more dangerous. I&amp;#39;m talking about in
school leadership.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What did schools do? Well some tried to make the best of a bad
situation. They recognized that the Mayor&amp;#39;s hybrid model was bunk and
while safe full time in person is clearly the best choice, fully
remote, even with its difficulties and limitations  would be more
sound than hybrid. Add to that the fact that if a school had to go
remote midstream you&amp;#39;d be set even further back &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;footnote-reference-1&#34; href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These schools
decided to basically set up remote from in school. Students who wanted
to or had to go to school would be sent to specific parts of the
school where they would receive the same remote instruction as their
classmates. This would accommodate students who couldn&amp;#39;t work from
home while allowing for a sensible overall schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sounds like good leadership to me and in some cases it is. On the
other hand, in some cases you have to  dig deeper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first question has to do with the student pods. Can they be set up
safely. What about entering and leaving? Bathrooms? Lunch? I&amp;#39;m
guessing some schools have a good plan in place but I&amp;#39;ve also heard
teachers refer to their upcoming student learning pods as &amp;#34;deathpods.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next question has to do with teachers working from the building or
from home. The DOE decreed that unless you get a medical excemption
you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to work from school. Who cares if you&amp;#39;re meeting students
in person or not, you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to be there. This was ridiculous. I&amp;#39;ve
already written about it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/&#34;&gt;scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach&lt;/a&gt;. This is where
leadership kicks in. I&amp;#39;ve heard through the grapevine that some
schools had teachers working from home without DOE permission. Sounds
like good leadership to me - trust your people to do the job and do
the right thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recently, the DOE backpedaled and gave schools the ability to allow
teachers to work from home without medical excemptions so long as it
worked within their COVID plans. Looks like some schools are jumping
on this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, others aren&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve heard of principals that are
setting up their schools to be &amp;#34;remote from school&amp;#34; but requiring all
teachers show up in person even though they clearly don&amp;#39;t need all of
them on site. This is the type of &amp;#34;leadership&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;ve come to expect
from many of the Bloomberg era principals I&amp;#39;ve met - you know, the
ones that barely taught for a cup of coffee. Insisting that teachers
brave the subways and share facilities like bathrooms only to spend
the day teaching in isolation serves no purpose other than to exert
power over them. If a teacher is teaching all remote and isn&amp;#39;t needed
for the pods, let them teach from home. They&amp;#39;ll be more comfortable
and thus more effective. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It sounds like some principals are being true educators and leaders in
these times but many are not and in these times when we can&amp;#39;t count on
our elected officials or his appointees to do the right thing, we need
all our principals to step up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnote-body&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note that I&amp;#39;m only talking here about the general population at
the high school level. I don&amp;#39;t claim to know the best format for the
younger grades and accomodating special needs students are a whole
different kettle of fish.

      <title>Quarter Century Courses</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/quarter-century-courses/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was talking in our Curriculum Development class last week about the
courses I&amp;#39;ve created over the years. From the first computer graphics
course to the current teacher education courses. JonAlf pointed out
that we missed an &amp;#34;important&amp;#34; occasion last spring - the twenty fifth
offering of my computer graphics class at Stuy. I haven&amp;#39;t taught it in
almost 10 years but it&amp;#39;s been running continuously for a quarter
century since it first ran back in the mid 90s. Systems will hit that
mark this year and the intro course I designed a couple of years from
now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s pretty cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking back at all the courses I&amp;#39;ve designed and taught it&amp;#39;s
interesting to see what I got right, what I got wrong, and why. Some
courses evolved slowly over time. The intro course fits that bill. On
the other hand, Systems had a complete reboot a few years in and has
been reasonably stable since. Interestingly enough Graphics has
probably been the most stable over the years. That&amp;#39;s not to say that
it hasn&amp;#39;t been tweaked here and there but overall, it&amp;#39;s largely the
same now as it was a quarter century ago. It&amp;#39;s been re-evaluated many
times but it just turns out that when I was teaching it I felt that it
was still hitting the right notes and my successor seems to feel
similarly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny because graphics was designed with the least thought of all of
my courses. I probably didn&amp;#39;t feel that way at the time, but it&amp;#39;s
true. I had only been teaching around 5 year - a beginner at best and
didn&amp;#39;t really know what I was doing. Even 10 years in you&amp;#39;re still an
advanced beginner in terms of teaching. Most teachers, if they don&amp;#39;t
burn out, hit there stride at 15 - 20 and after that become truly
experienced. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I basically created graphics because I was teaching 4 APCS/AB classes
and one geometry and &lt;strong&gt;hated&lt;/strong&gt; grading proofs!!!! I needed to create one
more CS class. I decided on graphics because I knew I could teach it
and thought the students might enjoy it. Systems was created using
similarly deep contemplations. I got better and spent much more time
and effort designing future courses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the graphics class I had a few choices to make but not many. The
students mostly only knew Pascal from APCS so the language wasn&amp;#39;t an
issue like it would become later on and since we were working on DOS
machines running Turbo Pascal there wasn&amp;#39;t any option to use any fancy
library like OpenGL. The course basically started with the ability to
draw a point and then went though: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lines
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lines in 3D and 3D transformations
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
polygons (triangles)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A motion description language interpreter (stack and tree based
shape hierarchies)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
lighting and shading
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
ray tracing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The motion description language piece had an entire unit that was
really an intro to compilers / interpreters. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In retrospect, the course really did make sense. It was taught to
second term seniors so it was a terminal course. It combined the
programming, algorithms and data structures from APCS, math they
did in trig, precalc (and baby calc), and a bit of physics. It as also
project based and they wrote programs that made pretty pictures so
that helped stave off senioritis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While the course has remained largely the same, there has been some
evolution. When Systems students started learning C we ended up
supporting that as well in graphics and now the course is more
language agnostic. We also played with topics and unit length. We
spend less time on the compiler piece now and treat that more like a
black box and have at times looked at additional topics like texture
mapping. There&amp;#39;s also been a good deal of work put in to safety nets
and scaffolding. When you have a course where the main assessment is
one BIG semester long project you&amp;#39;ve got to make sure students don&amp;#39;t
end up falling into a hole they can&amp;#39;t climb out of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not a surprise that the first couple of courses I designed -
graphics and systems were somewhat arbitrary. Graphics turned out to
be a solid design and just needed some fine tuning but Systems got a
complete reboot. Over the years, I learned more about curriculum
design and feel pretty comfortable designing new experiences now. Of
course, this is thirty years into my career as a teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I&amp;#39;ll talk about the design of other classes here in the future
but for now, you can look at one of my first student&amp;#39;s graphics
project and read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/class-legends/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Using Emacs 74 Eglot</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-74-eglot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:03:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-74-eglot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I primarily program in four languages these days -
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clojure 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C++
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Python
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Java
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And most of the time, my Emacs configuration has handled each one
differently. Cider for Clojure, Irony for C++, Elpy and Jedi for
Python and Java I could never figure out. This is of course on top of
tools that work across languages like company for completions, or
flycheck for general language syntax checking. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A while ago I heard about lsp-mode - Language Server Protocol
mode. Basically, you set up the mode and it connects to back end
language servers. The idea is to keep configuration down and provide a
consistent interface across langauges while leveraging the types of
support these back ends can provide. I wrote a bit about lsp-mode and
made a video and you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-58-lsp-mode/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I first tried LSP it just didn&amp;#39;t work. I tried it again later and
it basically worked but was finicky. Configuration took more work than
I wanted, particularly for customizing per language and even when
working it didn&amp;#39;t work as expected. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This past summer, I had to teach using Java so I tried lsp-mode
again. Setup wasn&amp;#39;t too bad and most of the issues were more related
to Java than to lsp-mode but I didn&amp;#39;t like the results. While it might
be great for the professional developer there were too many popups and
made the screen way too busy for teaching. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, the idea of a single simple configuration was enticing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, when I decided to get my configuration together for the Fall
semester I decided to try yet again and discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot&#34;&gt;eglot&lt;/a&gt; for
Emacs. Eglot turned out to be easier to install and gave me more of
the experience I was looking for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, I set it up for C++ using
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-text&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;(use-package eglot :ensure t)
(add-to-list &amp;#39;eglot-server-programs &amp;#39;((c++-mode c-mode) &amp;#34;clangd-10&amp;#34;))
(add-hook &amp;#39;c-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)
(add-hook &amp;#39;c++-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eglot defaults to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls&#34;&gt;ccls&lt;/a&gt; as a C++ language server. I didn&amp;#39;t want to have
to build it but was able to &lt;code&gt;apt-get install clangd-10&lt;/code&gt; and use that
instead by adding clangd-10 to the eglot-server-programs in the second
configuration line.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For python I had to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server&#34;&gt;pyls&lt;/a&gt;, the Python Language Server but that
was easy to do and then I just had to add &lt;code&gt;(add-hook &amp;#39;python-mode-hook
&amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt; to my config.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, Java was more of an issue I had to get &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls&#34;&gt;eclipse.jdt.ls&lt;/a&gt; on my
system. It turns out that lsp-mode installed it for me already so I
just had to point to it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;src src-text&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;(defconst my-eclipse-jdt-home &amp;#34;/home/zamansky/.emacs.d/.cache/lsp/eclipse.jdt.ls/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.5.800.v20200727-1323.jar&amp;#34;)
(defun my-eglot-eclipse-jdt-contact (interactive)
  &amp;#34;Contact with the jdt server input INTERACTIVE.&amp;#34;
  (let ((cp (getenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34;)))
    (setenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34; (concat cp &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; my-eclipse-jdt-home))
    (unwind-protect (eglot--eclipse-jdt-contact nil)
      (setenv &amp;#34;CLASSPATH&amp;#34; cp))))
(setcdr (assq &amp;#39;java-mode eglot-server-programs) #&amp;#39;my-eglot-eclipse-jdt-contact)
(add-hook &amp;#39;java-mode-hook &amp;#39;eglot-ensure)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far, I&amp;#39;m liking eglot very much. I&amp;#39;ll probably check lsp-mode out
again somewhere down the line but as of now it&amp;#39;s Cider for Clojure and
Eglot for everything else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video has a run through and demo. Check it out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Cameras For Remote Teaching</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/multiple-cameras-for-remote-teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:05:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/multiple-cameras-for-remote-teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We used Zoom for remote classes over the summer but at this point,
I&amp;#39;ve also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingrooms.com&#34;&gt;Coding Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bigbluebutton.org&#34;&gt;Big Blue Button&lt;/a&gt;, and Google meet as
well. They each have their own strong points and failings but all are
limited in terms of sharing multiple cameras and screen
components. All will let you share your camera or share your screen
and when you share you screen you can either share it all or a single
window. Zoom is the only one that seems to allow for easy camera
switching but it&amp;#39;s still pretty clunky.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why do I want to switch cameras? Because I can&amp;#39;t draw us ing a mouse or
touchpad. I&amp;#39;ve gotten myself a Wacom tablet but am still not
particularly proficient at it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I got myself one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TTIP40/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; to use as a document camera. It worked
but as I said, switching between the webcam and document camera was
clunky at best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OBS to the rescue!!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; Studio is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;&gt;Open Broadcaster Software&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a cross platform
streaming studio. You can set up any number of devices and then
compose them into scenes. I use it for recording my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; videos. It&amp;#39;s
easy to set up devices for every camera you own plus monitors and
individual windows. It only took a minute or so to set up a scene with
me in the corner and my desktop: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/desktop.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One for my document camera: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/doccam.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And one for my desktop with the doccam overlayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/obs/mixed.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can switch between them by clicking on which I want. I can also
select a transition like fade. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is all great for recording or streaming to a service like Twitch
but what about using with meeting software? It turns out that you can
set up OBS to act as a virtual camera. There are plugins for Mac and
Windows. You can find them by searching for them but for Linux, I
followed this video and it worked perfectly: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eca509IDLdM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also found this video if the above one doesn&amp;#39;t work: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJSkj-dLoI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaJSkj-dLoI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I set up the virtual camera as per the video and then selected it as
the camera on both Zoom and Coding Rooms and it worked perfectly. It
should work on the other platforms as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is HUGE. Now, instead of explicitly sharing my screen I can hacve
my screen as my image and quickly and easily switch over to another
window, a document camera or anything else. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re teaching remotely using a conferencing platform I recommend
you check this out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting the new semester</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-semester/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:56:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/new-semester/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Thursday was the first day of the new semester. The big change was
that my classes were done remotely but there were also some other
differences. Other changes were that I only met one of my two CS
classes on Thursday. That&amp;#39;s my CS0. I&amp;#39;m also teaching a recitation for
CS1 which only meets once a week. I&amp;#39;ll see those students as well as
my CS0 students for a second time on Monday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I opted to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://codingrooms.com/&#34;&gt;Coding Rooms&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom since Coding Rooms has a
nice built in REPL. We had a couple of students drop a couple of times
and I had to reload once but even that&amp;#39;s no worse than typical Zoom
performance. It&amp;#39;s funny how once one product becomes &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; everything
that&amp;#39;s different is labeled as harder and whenever there&amp;#39;s a hiccup
it&amp;#39;s so much worse. The truth is, I&amp;#39;ve now used a bunch of platforms
and none is harder than the others - you just have to look to
different places. For example, in Zoom, you &amp;#34;raise your hand&amp;#34; by
clicking in one place and in Coding Rooms (or Big Blue Button)
another. Neither is inherently better - just different but people seem
to think that the non Zoom one is worse just because Zoom got so hot
so fast. Likewise, other platforms periodically drop people and crash
but so does Zoom. This is all a digression but it&amp;#39;s something that
bothers me. Zoom does some things really well but then again so do the
other platforms I&amp;#39;ve been playing with. So far, there&amp;#39;s no silver
bullet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you might imagine, class had a different feel. I think it went
pretty well but it&amp;#39;s certainly going to be harder to build a sense of
community. Since there was a good deal of class logistics to cover we
didn&amp;#39;t really get to play with the Coding Rooms REPL but I&amp;#39;ll report
on that soon. I&amp;#39;ll also mention that we&amp;#39;re going to see about using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zulip.com/&#34;&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; instead of Slack for chat both in class and out. Like Zoom,
Slack is the de facto standard but Zulip seems to have a few distinct
advantages: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s open source
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can self host it (and it&amp;#39;s free if you self host)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s built around threads so I suspect it will be easier to deal
with discussions both synchronously and asynchronously more easily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The disadvantages are that there aren&amp;#39;t as many integrations, most
notably there&amp;#39;s no Giphy and it&amp;#39;s not the eponymous chat
platform. Note that it&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t like Slack but was driven to
look for alternatives because I don&amp;#39;t have a budget and the free tier
has limited history and I believe integrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big change this semester involve our K12 CS teacher
certification program. Our summer cohort kicked off there next two
classes on Thursday afternoon and evening - Ethics in Computer Science
and Curriculum Development for CS. I designed both courses but am not
the official teacher. Topher and JonAlf who worked the summer with me
are each taking one but I&amp;#39;m going to be very involved. We also had
four students start in our Masters program. I&amp;#39;ll be writing about all
of this over the course of the school year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spent most of yesterday getting ready for Monday - setting up the
Zulip server, GitHub repos and GitHub classroom and the like. As
usual, I&amp;#39;m a slow starter but hopefully by mid next week will feel
like I&amp;#39;m in the swing of things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unplugging with Bob Ross</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/unplugging-bob-ross/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 08:56:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/unplugging-bob-ross/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img width=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/practice.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long year since March. Many of us have not really been
able to leave NYC for a variety of reasons - financial, professional,
or family to name a few.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other than a couple of small escapes in the last two weeks we&amp;#39;ve been
home and working from home in our Manhattan apartment since this all
started. Early on we didn&amp;#39;t get out much and we still aren&amp;#39;t and that
does take its toll. You have to go out to shop but walking the same
streets over and over is a bit monotonous and far too few people seem
to understand that for masks to be helpful they have to cover both the
mouth and nose. Since recovering I do get out for a run most mornings
and that helps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I realized that one of the draining factors of being stuck in a NYC
apartment is that everything I was doing was on screens. I teach via
the computer and consume my news and communicate the same way. If I&amp;#39;m
working on a side programming project that&amp;#39;s more computer time as
well. If I watch some TV I&amp;#39;m just switching out one screen for
another. Even when I read which I&amp;#39;ve been doing much more of since the
outbreak it&amp;#39;s still on a screen!!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Devorah doesn&amp;#39;t have this problem - between her knitting, spinning,
and weaving she&amp;#39;s got plenty of non-screen time. She always said I
needed a hobby and as usual, was probably right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How about painting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/halloween.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Years ago, 1997 or 1998 I did Bob Ross for Halloween. It was an
absolute blast. I did a painting in each class and a couple by the
second floor bar. So much fun but I didn&amp;#39;t really know how to paint. I
watched the show a few times but that was it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/halloween2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I never really did anything after that Halloween - oil paints are
messy, take forever to try, are hard to clean, and require the use of
hazardous solvents. I put the stuff away in a closet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to today - we have water mixable oils which remove the
toxicity issued and makes clean up easier and there&amp;#39;s now a wealth of online
resources to learn from. I thought I&amp;#39;d give it another go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even with just a little practice, I&amp;#39;m starting to get better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/mountains.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And while it&amp;#39;s all a work in progress,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/islands1.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;50%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/islands2.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But it&amp;#39;s been fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/bobross/trees.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each time I paint it&amp;#39;s getting me away from a computer screen for an
hour or two and it&amp;#39;s been both relaxing and fun. The only downside is
that they still take forever to dry.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Looking back, what worked and what didn&amp;#39;t?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, things went very well. We were extremely happy with the
cohort&amp;#39;s growth and performance and based on feedback received they
were happy with the program so far. I&amp;#39;ll also say that while they&amp;#39;re
not finished yet, I can honestly say that every one of them would be a
boon to any school in the city in need of a CS teacher (but they&amp;#39;re
not available since they&amp;#39;re all already teaching CS at their
respective schools :-)). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before we started we felt good about our combination our program -
designed by teachers for teachers. Strong pedagogy combined with deep
CS content. Now that we&amp;#39;re done with the summer, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to
say that both our design and implementation is sound. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean the program was perfect. We lost one student along
the way. That was unfortunate but sometimes the fit isn&amp;#39;t there. There
are also a few things we&amp;#39;d like to tweak. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/pre-acceptance-prework&#34;&gt;pre-work&lt;/a&gt; - we required it due to the compressed nature of
the summer. Next time around it&amp;#39;s going to be available earlier and
with more support. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also want to do a better job with early pacing but now that we&amp;#39;ve
had our first rodeo we can do that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The one nut we haven&amp;#39;t cracked is that due to the teachers experience
combined with the pre-work there are some early learning / teaching CS
issues that didn&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t come up naturally as the students are
beyond them before our first day. Things like issues that come up when
introducing variables or functions. We could just insert them as a
unit but that breaks the class flow. I&amp;#39;m still noodling that one but
for now they&amp;#39;re probably good topics for a school year PD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#39;s next?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cohort will continue with two more courses starting up in just a
couple of weeks. One is an Ethics in CS class that I&amp;#39;m really excited
about and the other is Curriculum Development. The Curriculum
Development class has been a personal project. I had to take three
different graduate curriculum development courses over my career and
didn&amp;#39;t learn a single thing about designing curriculum in any of
them. Years ago, before I had any clue I&amp;#39;d be building this program I
told myself that if I ever did design and teach any education courses
I&amp;#39;d do a curriculum development course and it would be good. Well, her
it is. We&amp;#39;ll look at the standards and standard offerings but the crux
of the course will have the students designing curriculum. Since the
course is integrated with the NY State required field work they&amp;#39;ll
also be implementing what they build with their students. It should be
pretty cool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On top of all this, we also have four students starting in our Masters
in CS Education program. Those four are just starting their journey
towards becoming teachers. They&amp;#39;ll take general pedagogy courses in
teh Fall and Spring and then join with our next cohort in the summer
to start the CS and CS Ed part of our program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long road to get here but now we&amp;#39;re here - preparing CS
teachers for NY city and state. When I came to Hunter this was one of
my two major initiatives. The thought was that regardless how bad the
powers that be screw CS education up, if you have great teachers,
students have a chance. At Hunter we&amp;#39;re preparing those great
teachers.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS Teachers - building a community</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-community/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:11:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-community/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
What so many non-teachers just don&amp;#39;t get is culture and community can
be so much more powerful than curriculum. The problem is, culture and
community are harder to create, curate, and maintain and the results
don&amp;#39;t always show up on standardized tests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t force community or culture  in a classroom but you can try
your best to foster it. It&amp;#39;s ultimately up to the class as a
whole. It&amp;#39;s like I tell groups who come to events I organize. I can&amp;#39;t
make an event awesome, all I can do is bring everyone together and set
the stage. It&amp;#39;s up to us all to collectively make the event work. More
often than not, it does. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For our part, we did what we always do. We did our best to be open and
honest about what we were doing, how, and why. We sincerely tried to
listen to input and we worked to make ourselves available to our
students. We also looked to set our class tone as informal but
serious, and hopefully fun. We could take time for tangents but
remembered when it was time to get back on task. It&amp;#39;s the typical
balance a teacher seeks to create and maintain. There was no magic on
our end, we did what we always did - we were ourselves. It probably
helped that there were three of us and could already play off each
other Marx brothers style (oh, who am I kidding, more three stooges)
but all a teacher can really do is open the door. The other thing we
did was provide the tools - Slack and GitHub Discussions (even though
it didn&amp;#39;t take) and we did pre-load Slack with channels both serious
and not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The class walked through. They decided to engage and that started the
ball rolling. Of course we still had our part to play. If they posted
something, we had to respond, or at least be an active part in the
discussion. Now, understand, we didn&amp;#39;t respond as &amp;#34;part of the job.&amp;#34;
That would be fake and they&amp;#39;d know it. We&amp;#39;d respond because we&amp;#39;re also
part of the community. We wanted them to be part of it and we wanted
to be part of it. That&amp;#39;s what community is all about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While community and class culture is something that&amp;#39;s always
important. In this case, I think it&amp;#39;s even more important. New York
City and State, like the rest of the country has very few CS teachers
that are both strong in CS content and in CS pedagogy and since NY
State just started approving certification programs, including ours,
there are currently no state certified CS teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When they finish the program, this cohort should be among New York&amp;#39;s
first certified CS teachers but even now, they have more CS content
knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge than most of the people
teaching CS. They&amp;#39;re also all experienced teachers in general. This
group can seed a community of CS teachers with strong
backgrounds. It&amp;#39;s on them to go back to CS4All in and run professional
developments and to work with us at Hunter to host events as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ve already said how terrific the group is and how honored I
am to work with them and as a community we&amp;#39;re well on the way. Even as
I&amp;#39;m writing this post, I&amp;#39;m seeing new messages appear on our community
Slack discussion school openings and this is well after our summer
program has ended. They&amp;#39;re already becoming resources for each
other. In a couple of weeks, for their students, and soon for the rest
of the teachers in New York.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS Teachers - tools for remote instruction</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 06:07:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Our summer intensive was supposed to be in person but COVID-19 changed
that in a hurry. We had to scramble to redesign and figure out how we
were going to run things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We decided to go with the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Zoom for live meetings 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Slack for chat
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Git and GitHub
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub classroom for assignments 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub repos for code distribution, class website and resource
sharing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub discussions for off hour and long form discussion
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Zoom is a great platform it was lacking in a few areas so we
also ended up using: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://padlet.com&#34;&gt;Padlet&lt;/a&gt; as a collaborative writing space for groups
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Assorted whiteboarding tools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the breakdown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We used Zoom as you might imagine - big zoom for direct instruction
and whole class work and lots of breakout rooms. Screen sharing worked
great but the whiteboarding was less than ideal so we turned to screen
sharing with other tools. The big things missing from Zoom were a
collaborative writing/drawing space and flexibility for breakout
rooms. I would have loved to be able to spy on a breakout room or have
more fluidity between them but it still did a pretty good job
considering Zoom wasn&amp;#39;t designed for education. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bigbluebutton.org/&#34;&gt;Big Blue Button&lt;/a&gt; is an open source alternative to Zoom. It&amp;#39;s design for
teaching so it has some of the features that Zoom lacks but it&amp;#39;s not
quite there yet in terms of quality and reliability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of the Zoom chat, we decided to use Slack. Zoom&amp;#39;s chat only
works while Zoom is up and there were times when the cohort was
working &amp;#34;offline.&amp;#34; Also, slack gave us both threads and different
channels as well as arbitrary private chats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the general class chat we had channels like #git-fu, #java-fu, #fall-is-coming to discuss COVID-19 and the public schools,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Funny thing - this was the first time any of us had strong Slack
adoption. We&amp;#39;ve tried it before but never got buy in. This time we
did. Maybe because we were together morning through afternoon and when
we broke we were still in the same physical location with out
computers nearby. In any event, Slack was used for both in class and
out of class communication and is still being used now albeit at a
lower volume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Slack also gave us a place, besides the zoom to build
community. Having some fun channels like #duckygram and #cs-educationy-goodness  set a light tone. Every day, Alex would wait
until right before our start to put a gif in the #attendance channel
each day outdoing the ridiculousness of the rest of the class. It was
the cohort that made the community but Slack as a platform helped.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m wondering if a I&amp;#39;ll get better buy in with my undergrads in a few
weeks as we&amp;#39;re starting the semester online but at least for this
cohort, it worked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My only problem with Slack is the price. I have zero budget which
leaves us with the free tier. That means limited integrations  and
limited history. I might check out some self-hosted options like Zulip
and Rocketchat to see if they&amp;#39;re viable alternatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We originally planned to use GitHub discussions for longer form
communication. It hit most of the buttons for me – threaded
discussion, reply via email, customizable alerts. All good. It&amp;#39;s
lacking tags and search but it looked like it could be a viable long
form discussion platform. We kicked off with it but the class voted
with their feet. They kept going back to Slack so while GitHub was our
main platform for code, GitHub discussions fell by the wayside as
Slack won the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Along the way we learned some tricks. Even though Topher was paid for
teaching two courses, JonAlf two, and I was just officially
supervising and coordinating, all three of us were pretty much on all
the time. Ones strategy that developed was having one of us man Slack
while another ran the Zoom. I might be running a Zoom based activity
while Topher or JonAlf would answer questions or highlight and
emphasize key points on Slack. I don&amp;#39;t know yet if it helped the class
educationally or was a distraction but we all liked the
flow. Something to look at further. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We also had to figure out how not to double or triple respond to
questions. We each adopted an emoji and when a question was asked,
whoever got there first would mark the thread with that emoji letting
the others know we had it covered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another skill we mastered was the &amp;#34;slack-moji&amp;#34; poll - pre-staging
Slack polls and content to cut and paste over. Actually, there&amp;#39;s a
cool remote class tool, &lt;a href=&#34;https://prismia.chat/&#34;&gt;Primsia&lt;/a&gt; (formerly babylon.hosue) which is much
better at that than Slack but it isn&amp;#39;t up 24x7 and is more set up for
a teacher actively managing class discussion rather than a free form
chat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;d love to see Big Blue Button grow to be a suitable Zoom replacement
as it&amp;#39;s better suited for education and I&amp;#39;m hoping that Zulip proves
to be a good free alternative to Slack but regardless of specific
tool, the combination of video conferencing, chat, long form message,
and whiteboarding make up a pretty good remote classroom. It would be
nice if collaborative coding was easier but there aren&amp;#39;t that many
options there. &lt;a href=&#34;https://repl.it&#34;&gt;Repl.it&lt;/a&gt; is awesome but we decided to have them develop
on their local machines and adding a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://floobits.com/&#34;&gt;Floobits&lt;/a&gt; would have
been too much to ask for most of the cohort. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We think it all went pretty well. If given the option next summer, I&amp;#39;m
leaning towards a hybrid program as even without COVID-19, remote is
easier for many teachers for geographic and school scheduling
reasons. I figure open in person and maybe do one day or a couple of
half days a week on site and the rest remote. I think we&amp;#39;ll talk about
it as a cohort once the Fall begins and can start thinking about
cohort 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS teachers - Curricula don&#39;t add richness, teachers do</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics-curriculum/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:25:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics-curriculum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve frequently been asked for curricula. I&amp;#39;ll hear from a school or
someone otherwise involved in a school or education and they&amp;#39;ll ask
for a course they can drop in and teach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I explain it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way. A syllabus or curriculum is only
so good. A great curriculum with a bad teacher will still be bad but a
great teacher can do a lot to salvage a horrible curriculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A curriculum only goes so far. At it&amp;#39;s most sparse, it&amp;#39;s a list of
topics. At the other end we frequently see worked out prescribed
lessons that can be a boon to a beginner but in the end constrains
great teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a side note, this was something I noticed years ago when touring
elementary schools for my own children. We saw one school where
everything was in lockstep - every classroom looked basically the
same. Every teacher taught the same subject at the same time as every
other teacher each day and what they taught and how they taught it was
tightly controlled. We opted for  a school where the teachers were
much more free to actually teach. The school in question was well
regarded and the more we dug in the more we realized that the
strictness the principal imposed helped bring the bad teachers up to a
certain level and got most students through the standardized tests but
there was no joy. Great teachers weren&amp;#39;t allowed to teach. It was a
perfect example of a Bloomberg era stat mill. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway back to CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was thinking about this while we watched the summer cohort&amp;#39;s topic
presentations. Three of the topics were ones that I teach annually -
AI Search, NLP, and Cipher decryption. Some of the others I&amp;#39;m planning
on mixing in next year. The presentations and supporting materials
were all terrific but in every case, the teachers chose to spin and
emphasize aspects different to those I would emphasize.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the case of the cipher decryption lesson, the cohort emphasized the
machine learning type aspect. I spin the lesson more towards a
recommender system. Neither is better or worse. My guess is that we
each selected aspects that were exciting to us and riffed on
those. Similarly the other groups brought up nuances and emphases that
differed from mine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was terrific.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you look at a syllabus, the search topic might just say &amp;#34;Depth
First Search.&amp;#34; It might be in the recursion section of the class and
thus lead you to teaching a recursive solution or it might be in
the data structure / stack section and lead you to implement your own
stack. If the curriculum is fleshed out it&amp;#39;ll give more specifics but
will it talk about states and state space? How about implicit data
structures? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s so much richness to a well taught course that&amp;#39;s never captured
by a curriculum and that includes tangents, side stories and limitless
discoveries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I talk to my students decades later it&amp;#39;s usually not those lines
on the syllabus they remember but the richness that lives in the ether
of a well taught class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So cool that our certification program created an environment where
we&amp;#39;ve been able to mix the spices from so many different chefs and
each of us is leaving with something new and richer.

      <title>Preparing CS Teachers - what to leave in, what to leave out</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-methods-choosing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:37:12 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Teachers always make decisions in their courses - what to leave in,
what to leave out. I&amp;#39;ve seen programming and data structure classes
where everything is written from scratch and others where a few things
are explained and the students just use built in types like the
java LinkedList  or Arrays.sort() method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Do too much from scratch and you&amp;#39;ll never finish the curriculum. Do to
little and the students won&amp;#39;t really understand what&amp;#39;s going on and
walk a path towards being programmers or coders rather than computer
scientists. Most teachers work somewhere between the extremes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We not only had to make these decisions for our CS content but also
for our methods. We decided to leave out two particular
methods that are very popular - pair programming and Parsons
problems. We did mention both in passing and did a little talk on pair
programming but the treatment was far less than say live coding,
subgoal labeling or the many other teaching techniques we decided to
explicitly cover. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why did we leave out these two topics? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Partly pragmatism and pragmatism is something that&amp;#39;s always left out
when talking about teaching. Let&amp;#39;s look at Parsons problems. If you&amp;#39;re
unfamiliar with them, they&amp;#39;re basically scrambled code
fragments. Students have to put them in order. They&amp;#39;re cool puzzles
and a nice change of pace. but you have to create them and get them to
your students. That didn&amp;#39;t fit all that well with us. By the time we
got to content that would benefit from Parsons problems our pace or approach
didn&amp;#39;t really fit using them. It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that we haven&amp;#39;t
seen any good online Parson problem generator systems which would be
both a boon to problem creation and potentially distribution and
assessment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There just wasn&amp;#39;t that much bang for the buck in giving them more than
lip service. Since our cohort was composed of experienced teachers, we
were confident that they can find the appropriate Parsons problems
resources and use them where appropriate in their classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On pair programming we had similar pragmatic issues - it didn&amp;#39;t fit
all that well given how tight the program was and we had to figure out
how bet to do it remotely on the fly. We also knew that the cohort had
all been to at least some NYC CS4All training and so were at least
exposed to the idea. Still, we, or more accurately, Topher, who&amp;#39;s had
great success getting student buy in did do a brief talk on the
subject. Some of the things we covered were: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How to motivate pair programming in a collaborative way
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What activities can you give the navigator while the driver&amp;#39;s
setting up the environment to involve them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How in the &amp;#34;real world&amp;#34; some developers love PP and some hate it
and that there are many variations on the theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You&amp;#39;d not always going to get student buy in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That last point is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important. Teachers are going to try things
that don&amp;#39;t always work and unfortunately, the system of evaluation
doesn&amp;#39;t promote such necessary experimentation. What&amp;#39;s more every time
you go to a professional development or training session or head
something online it&amp;#39;s about how the presented did it and it worked
perfectly and if you follow the same recipe it&amp;#39;ll work for you. It
might, but then, it might not. It&amp;#39;s all about building the toolbox of
tricks and using them when appropriate and even then, not every lesson
is going to be John Keating or Jaime Escalante on the big screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, in the end we made choices. We&amp;#39;re they the right ones? I think
so. Next time around the cohort will be different and the
circumstances a little as well. Will we make the same choices? Maybe,
we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Teacher Certification - Topics in CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 07:13:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-topics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Officially, the last course of the summer was &amp;#34;Modern Topics in
Computer Science.&amp;#34; The idea was that K12 CS teachers on the one hand
need depth beyond the typical terminal high school course, hence data
structures and also breadth so that they could create electives, mix
teasers in to the regular courses, or help precocious students with
independent or semi-independant explorations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If someone was teaching this in a typical fall or spring semester
course, they&amp;#39;d probably have a list of topics and spend a couple of
weeks on each. We wanted to do it a little differently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original thought was to integrate some of the topics in with the
earlier computer science but there weren&amp;#39;t too many opportunities due
to the compressed nature of the program. Instead, a few days before we
wrapped up data structures we gave the cohort a list of potential
topics and asked them to select one. Since the cohort had all already
been teaching CS and had differing content backgrounds we also
encouraged them to choose a topic not on the list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When it was time for them to begin work on the topics part of the
intensive, they all shared their desired topic. Fortunately, things
worked out. We ended up with two solo students and a bunch of small
teams. The teams were tasked with learning about the topic and
designing a lesson or unit covering it. This could be for their
current students or some other hypothetical group. Each group would
also have to create a program or programs to show an implementation
and or use of the topic. Once they chose their topics, we picked a few
out of the remaining selections as topics that we&amp;#39;d present. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next few days were Topher, JonAlf and I delivering our topics and
the cohort working in groups. When they worked, we&amp;#39;d drop in and
support. The final two days consisted of the groups presenting their
work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The topics they selected were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Mining
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Public Key Encryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blockchain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Natural Language Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Decision Trees
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SQL / Cyber Security
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Visualization
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Machine Learning / Cipher Decryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Genetic Algorithms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Search
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We weren&amp;#39;t sure exactly what to expect but we were blown away both in
terms of the CS content as well as what they prepared in terms of
lessons and units. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this is just year one of the program we thought we&amp;#39;d get ahead
of the game and set up a site where we could host and share these
units and other resources so check them out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/Teacher-Resources/blob/master/README.org&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We didn&amp;#39;t have a strict format for the cohort to use so each one is a
little different but each link&amp;#39;s README.md file will get you started.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I said, we were blown away by their work but super proud that we
also have the bonus of being able to make their work available to the
general CS Ed community. If you&amp;#39;re looking to create a unit in any of
these, check them out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing CS Teachers - adding methods to our madness</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-methods/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 06:47:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-methods/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Our summer intensive was, well, pretty intensive. We met all day every
day for a month and knocked out four classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programming (CS1)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Structures
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Topics
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Methods
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you ever took or taught a summer session class, you know that time
is tight and generally you cover a little less than in a fall or
spring semester class. N credits in 5 weeks just isn&amp;#39;t the same as
those same N credits spread over 13. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How did we recapture some time? First, we had some pre-work and second
we integrated some of the courses. We couldn&amp;#39;t really do it with
programming and data structures and we were less successful at
integrating the topics than we liked but it made the most sense with
methods, in fact, I think the methods part of the class was more
successful as a result of it&amp;#39;s integration with the other subjects
than it would have been as a stand alone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what we did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We first thought about covering methods as we taught topics - that is,
present something using some teaching technique, cover the topic and
then also dive in to the technique. This turned out to be a
mistake. The teachers that came in with a strong CS background  seemed
fine but for the ones newer to the subject matter, it was too much at
once. We had to alter course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we did.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We continued to model various methods and sometimes made a side remark
here or there but focused on the CS. After a few days in, we were
ready to spend a day on pedagogy. We broke the class into groups and
had them reflect on the content we taught - how did we teach it? Why
did we approach it the way we did? Did it work? This led to some rich
discussion of both CS teaching techniques and teaching in general. We
were very happy with how it all went.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We then went back to content but added more side bits here and there
about the teaching methods - as they became more comfortable with the
CS we were able to integrate more methods talk in with the CS talk. At
our next formal pedagogy lesson, we again talked about new techniques
that were modeled but also looked at alternative approaches and
took a deeper look at our individual cohort members student
populations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of the methods we discussed included: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Live Coding 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Subgoal labeling
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make predictions
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Modifying existing code
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
code tracing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
diagramming
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
scaffolded assignments (code skeletons)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rubber Duck Debugging
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Code sharing (presenting)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
writing implementations of library code
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
slack techniques (reacts polls, channels, ) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
thought-grooming/sparking warm-up Qs/tasks
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
relevant quotes at warm-up
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and more but the list doesn&amp;#39;t really do the discussion justice. Take
&amp;#34;live coding&amp;#34; for example - that&amp;#39;s not just writing code in front of
the class. There&amp;#39;s a rich discussion here - how do you narrate? Is it
truly live or from a note sheet? How about discussing workflow while
modeling it? How about live coding subgoals? The actual class is much
richer than just &amp;#34;live coding.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to integrating methods into the teaching of content, we
also merged it with the topics course for some of the assessment. For
topics, each group created a class or unit on some area of CS and
included in the documents they prepared and presentation was a
discussion of how it might bet taught. I know that they all came in as
experienced teachers so weren&amp;#39;t starting with nothing but man, they
knocked it out of the park. I&amp;#39;ll be talking more about the topics in a
later post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll probably say this a lot in my summer intensive wrap up posts but
it was such a treat working with a cohort of great educators and also
to have two of the best teachers I know to work with as the teaching
team.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing teachers to teach CS</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-recap-intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 06:16:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-recap-intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that the summer portion of Hunter College&amp;#39;s Advanced Certificate
in Teaching Computer Science is over I thought I&amp;#39;d do a
postmortem. That is, a few posts about what we did and how it all
went. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, though, an overview of the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Advanced Certificate program is geared towards teachers who are
currently certified in another subject area who wish to earn an
additional New York State teaching certificate in Computer
Science. Aspiring teachers - people who don&amp;#39;t currently have either a
Masters degree or any teaching certification can enroll in our Masters
in Computer Science Education program. We&amp;#39;re starting a small cohort
of five on that in the Fall. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The certificate program consists of a bunch of graduate classes plus
field work which is required by the state. Over the summer we covered
four of the classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Programming - essentially a CS1 type course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Structures - since K12 teachers should go deeper than the last
HS course which is typically APCS-A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Topcs in Compute rScience - since K12 teachers need a wide breadth
of CS knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Methods - since teachers need to know how to teach CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the fall, we&amp;#39;ll continue with Ethics in Computer Science and
Curriculum Development which also includes the field work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For this summer we started with a cohort of 22 practicing teachers but
lost one along the way. They all came from different schools and we
had all five boroughs represented. Most of the teachers worked in high
schools but we had some middle school representation and in terms of
current certifications, we had at least math, special ed, and science
represented but that&amp;#39;s something we didn&amp;#39;t officially track.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Staffing wise, it was me along with two of my long time collaborators
JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver and Topher Mykolyk. JonAlf and Topher are two of
the best educators out there and part of my former core team at
Stuy. That team is the biggest thing I still miss having come over to
Hunter. They&amp;#39;re quite simply the best.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The program ran basically all day every day during the month of
July. we knew it would be tight so we also added on some pre-work
which made sure all participants had some experience with Java prior
to our official start. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More will be revealed over the next few posts but I&amp;#39;ll spoil the
ending - I&amp;#39;m super proud of our 21 participants - while they still
have more work to do to earn their certifications, if I ran a school,
I&amp;#39;d love to have any of them teaching my CS classes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m not planning on writing much about the programming and data
structure classes except possibly through the methods eye because both
of those courses are pretty well established and cut and dry but I do
plan to write at least the following: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The methods course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
More on the methods course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The topics course 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Use of tools for remote teaching 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our overall philosophy in designing and running the program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, stay tuned for more.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scared teachers can&#39;t teach and scared students won&#39;t learn</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 13:23:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/scared-teachers-scared-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been reading a lot of takes on NYC schools reopening. We&amp;#39;ve had
daily conversations about it with our summer teachers but
conversations abound on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many salient points have been raised - given the DOE&amp;#39;s track record,
can they make things safe and will they? Can they be trusted? Given
that any policy needs all players to follow the rules - students,
teachers, and staff how can that ever happen? What happens when a
parent want&amp;#39;s their kid in school but wants to opt out of wearing a
mask? What happens if kids just straight out refuse? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s logistics and teacher workload - even if you have fewer
kids in school there will still be far too many on subway platforms
and who knows if they&amp;#39;ll be masked outside of the school
building. What about bathrooms and class changeovers? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then there&amp;#39;s that little matter of teachers having to now, instead of
just five classes which is already too many could effectively be asked
to teach double or more - the result of splitting their classes into
live and remote. There&amp;#39;s also the way they want the live teaching to
work which basically reduces the in person instruction to a remote
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What isn&amp;#39;t being talked about is discomfort and fear. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From what I can tell, a lot of teachers are afraid for their
health. Not mildly concerned, afraid. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I would be
too. I&amp;#39;m betting a lot of students are also afraid of going back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How effective is a teacher going to be when they feel that any
interaction or even too much time in the wrong space might get them
sick or worse. Same for students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After 9/11 we relocated to Brooklyn Tech. It was surreal
and weird but it felt fine. I taught, they learned. We were pushed
back to Stuy too early. You could still smell the smoke from the
smoldering wreckage of ground zero and there were concerns about the
air quality. It was on a lot of our minds all the time we were down on
Chambers street. It was certainly on my mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know that I wasn&amp;#39;t teaching at anything resembling my normal level
and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the kids weren&amp;#39;t learning nearly as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, the smoke cleared, they cleaned the building again (and
stole a lot of valuables) and set up sensors that at least seemed more
accurate and after a period of time we felt normal or at least close
enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, that was from a single event not an ongoing pandemic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t believe for one second that NYC schools will be safe for
teachers and students in the fall but even if they were, if teachers
and students don&amp;#39;t feel safe, student learning will suffer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get that there are downsides to staying remote but don&amp;#39;t fool
yourself into believing that just because you&amp;#39;re sending your kid to
school they&amp;#39;ll be socializing and doing all that good in person
stuff. They&amp;#39;ll be sitting in rows watching a projector and then
shuffled home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sure, remote is not as good as normal in person classes but don&amp;#39;t
blame teachers, blame the pandemic. These are exceptional times and
bad and unsafe  in person &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; are much worse than safety of
remote. At the end of the day, this pandemic will pass and we will get
back to in person. So what if a for a year students don&amp;#39;t reach some
arbitrary standard bar because remote is sub-optimal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if safe, scared teachers can&amp;#39;t teach and scared students won&amp;#39;t
learn.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter College CS Teacher Certification - Final Project Fun Time</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 10:09:25 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-presentations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Well, we just delivered the last formal piece of instruction for the
summer intensive. Writing this post between visits to breakout rooms
as the cohort works on their final projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow and Thursday will be presentation time. Each group will give
spend thirty minutes teaching us all about some topic in CS along with
the plan for how we could teach the topic to our kids. We&amp;#39;ve got a few
more things to talk about as a group but it&amp;#39;s mostly time to sit back
and enjoy the show.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s been a long hard month for JonAlf Topher and me. A lot of work
goes in to a first time program and when you&amp;#39;re meeting every day all
day with off hours student support there&amp;#39;s not a lot of time for the
inevitable steering that comes with something new.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now though we can sit back and enjoy some presentations by some great
teachers and provide some meaningful feedback. We&amp;#39;ve got a nice list
of topics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blockchain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Genetic Algorithms
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Mining
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Machine Learning
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Natural Language Processing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Public Key Encryption
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Data Visualization
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - Decision Trees
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Classic AI - search
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Databases / SQL
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Obviously we&amp;#39;re not going to learn everything about topics like NLP or
ML but rather a single unit that can be done in a lass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the end, the idea is that every cohort member will have a nice set
of topics and support materials from which to choose for their classes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Should be a lot of fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CS Certification summer intensive - the home strecth</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-home-stretch/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 07:30:32 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-home-stretch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve a week to go in the summer intensive part of our CS teacher
certification program so after an intense few weeks, I can start to
breath a little. There&amp;#39;s still a lot to be done but I feel like I can
breath. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first three and a half weeks covered programming and data
structures with a bunch of pedagogy mixed in. This meant a lot of day
to day adjustment of what we were teaching and how we were teaching
it, after all, this is the first time a program like this has ever
existed let alone shifted from in person to remote. Now we&amp;#39;ve moved in
to the last course - Topics, combined with yet more pedagogy. This is
the easy part. Each cohort member selected some area of computer
science that is both new to them and not covered in a typical K12 CS
class. We provided some ideas but they were free to come up with their
own. They&amp;#39;re spending time learning about the topic and designing a
lesson or unit around it. The deliverable is a unit plan with
resources and guidance on preferred pedagogy techniques and a code
implementation of the topic. The idea is that in addition to showing
their own expertise that other cohort members can use the project as a
resource for their own classes at some future date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next few days consist of us supporting their work while mixing in
a few lessons on topics that they didn&amp;#39;t select. Much easier than the
first few weeks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to some cool presentations - Blockchain, public key
encryption, some machine learning and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Really happy about how this has all played out.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tools matter when teaching (and learning)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tools-matter/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:52:24 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/tools-matter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
One of our teacher certification cohort members asked for some help on
our Slack the other day. It was about a side project - he was learning
him so Javascript. It&amp;#39;s always very cool to see teachers exploring
things that can help with their craft on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The whole situation reminded me  about how important good tooling is
and why, in spite of its popularity, javascript has some severe issues
as a learning language and I&amp;#39;m a guy that actually likes javascript. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The project was a small interactive javascript todo application and he was
having trouble getting a button to react. I grabbed his code off
GitHub, fired up a server and took a look. Indeed, there were
issues. Some of the interface worked - you could type in a new item
and hit enter or click an add button and it worked. You could check or
uncheck items and you could delete them individually. Everything
worked except the clear button which did nothing. Weird.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Exploring the code, here were some of the key sections:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// there were sections like this
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterOption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.filter-todo&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;clearButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.clear-button&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// then more code 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// then some of this
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterOption&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterTodo&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;clearButton&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;clearTodos&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// and more code
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just pulled out the lines relevant to what he was doing and to the
error so be aware that it&amp;#39;s all out of context. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;document.querySelector&lt;/code&gt; lines get references to DOM elements -
elements on the page. The &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt; then links a function to
the event. So, when you click on the &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; button on the web site,
it&amp;#39;s supposed to run the function &lt;code&gt;clearTodos&lt;/code&gt; and when you click on
the &lt;strong&gt;filter&lt;/strong&gt; button it will run &lt;strong&gt;fiterTodo&lt;/strong&gt;. There&amp;#39;s more linking of
events to elements in the code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was really weird was that parts and in fact most of the interface
was working and just the clear button was not. To make matters worse,
looking both at the server output and the actual web page, there was
no indication of anything wrong. Even if you looked at the developers
console in the browser it didn&amp;#39;t really give you a clue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t take me &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; long to find the error but that&amp;#39;s only because
I spent hours on similar errors back when I learned javascript. Back
then though I lost hours of time on errors like these and I was
learning JS decades into my career as a computer science teacher and
professional.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was going on?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When javascript executes  &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; it returns a reference to an
element in the web page. If that element doesn&amp;#39;t exist, it returns
 &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. As it turned out, at least in the version I looked at, there
was no element on the page identified by the class &lt;strong&gt;filter-todo&lt;/strong&gt;. The
result was that after executing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterOption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.filter-todo&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;filterOption&lt;/code&gt; is set to refer to null.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then later, this code: 
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterOption&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;click&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filterTodo&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
crashes the program because you can&amp;#39;t call the &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;
method on &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; which is what &lt;code&gt;filterOption&lt;/code&gt; is set to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Therein lies the problem. I commented out the two lines, the program
ran, and the &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; button was clickable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The killer was that the tool gave some pretty weird results - it
wasn&amp;#39;t all or nothing. Parts of the interface responded but parts
didn&amp;#39;t. There was no actionable feedback. The only feedback was indeed
this error: &lt;strong&gt;TypeError: filterOption is null&lt;/strong&gt; but this seems wholly
unrelated to the clear button and since most of the interface was
responsive it seemed even weirder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My best guess was that the web browser executed the JS code
until the crash so anything that parts of the user interface that were
wired up prior to that null pointer reference did indeed run.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The lack of feedback and this manner of execution can make javascript
really tough on both beginners and self learners. It&amp;#39;s also tough with
a teacher if they don&amp;#39;t really know the ins and outs of the toolset.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was all just a reminder that tools matter. Java, Python, and C++
might not give the best error messages but generally the tooling isn&amp;#39;t
so bad. They could of course, be better, and I&amp;#39;m not arguing that any
of them are ideal learning environments but JS has a long way to
go. On the other hand, languages and environment specifically made for
learning have issues as well. The bottom line in choice of tools is
that there&amp;#39;s no magic bullet and the answer is as usual, &amp;#34;it depends.&amp;#34;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github and Student Feedback</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-student-feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 16:12:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/github-student-feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Beyond the CS specifics We&amp;#39;ve been primarily using three tools in our
summer certification program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Zoom for video conferencing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Slack for text based communicaiton
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
GitHub for just about everything else
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We use GitHub as a CMS - a place to share code and assignments as well
as collect them. We&amp;#39;re also playing with GitHub discussions although
that&amp;#39;s fallen somewhat to the wayside with Slack being preferred. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the choices I&amp;#39;m digging more than ever is &lt;a href=&#34;https://classroom.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Classroom&lt;/a&gt; for
assignments. Recently GitHub added a feedback feature powered through
what known as Pull Requests. You just have to check the &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34;
button when you create an assignment. I also set my notifications so I
receive an email alert whenever a students submits anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whenever a student updates an assignment or in Git parlance commits
and pushes up a change, I get an email alert. The email includes: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The repo where the change was made 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A brief message describing the most recent change
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A link the the students GitHub account
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A link to the actual change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Clicking on the change and I get to a screen like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/githubdiff.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A summary of exactly what changed. I see lines that were deleted,
lines that were added and lines that were modified. At the top I see
the one line brief description which the student put in when making
the commit. I can also easily navigate through their assignment both
to see other parts of it as well as earlier versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you scroll down the page there&amp;#39;s a place you can leave a comment
which will go to the student. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This all makes for a very quick and easy feedback mechanism. You can
also go to the &amp;#34;pull request&amp;#34; section of the repo (link at the top of
the repo page) where you can find all the comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all this provides a very quick and painless way of seeing what
students are up to and a quick way to provide some feedback.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only catch is that this only works when the students actively push
changes up to GitHub. While this group of teachers have been great
that&amp;#39;s sometimes a challenge with high school or college
students. Working on strategies to get this type of buy in from my
first years in the Fall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, GitHub Classroom&amp;#39;s feedback mechanism? A big win and more great
work from the GitHub education team.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Merge Over Zoom - A Hunter CS Certification Program Update</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 19:00:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/merge-over-zoom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;ve been talking sorting and searching in our teacher certification
program and today was all about the merge sort. One of the strategies
we use when teaching it in person involves sorting a deck of cards by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-27-dumbass/&#34;&gt;Tom Sawyering&lt;/a&gt; it with the class. It&amp;#39;s fun and it&amp;#39;s effective but you
can&amp;#39;t do it over Zoom. What to do? We didn&amp;#39;t want to just jump into
the nuts and bolts of merge sort. We could - we&amp;#39;ve got a great group
of teachers who could handle it but we&amp;#39;re not just talking about
content in the program we&amp;#39;re also talking about pedagogy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How could we adapt a divide and conquer algorithm where we split a
deck of cards and pass it out to the class to a remote environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s what we came up with.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started with a story about how I pitched Hunter about having a party
with this first cohort when they all earn their NY State CS Teaching
Certificates (assuming we could have a party in person). They said yes
but to keep costs down I had to get them a list of possible
restaurants to order from sorted by lowest price. We decided to use
Chinese restaurants and the price of pork dumplings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had a long list and was going to have to go to the seamless page for
each one and get the price and then sort them. Not fun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since I&amp;#39;m running the program but have two instructors - JonAlf and
Topher working with me, we decided I could &amp;#34;volunteer&amp;#34; each to do half
the list. They weren&amp;#39;t happy so they looked for Teaching Assistants to
pawn the work off on but having none went to the students. We
continued with the split until a bunch of students each had to look up
one and only one restaurant to find the price of the pork. We then
passed the restaurants and prices back up the chain and voila - merge
sort. .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We basically were able to replicate the in class card sorting
experience with something that we could do over Zoom. It went over
pretty well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re going to talk more about what we did and why and the idea of
actively engaging students in different ways over virtual conference
technologies tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was all pretty cool.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Conferences - CSTA 2020 part 2</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/csta-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 19:32:17 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/csta-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Now that CSTA 2020&amp;#39;s over time for some more thoughts on the
conference and also on virtual conferences in general.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I only got to attend a couple of sessions as I was working my CS
teacher certification program but a nice feature is that I was able to
hop in and out of sessions without disturbing or disrupting. You can&amp;#39;t
really do that in person. I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to when they
release the sessions for later viewing. In addition to not being able
to get to everything I wanted, my session overlapped with Nifty
Assignments - always a fun show. Now I still get to see it!!!!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of my session, JonAlf and I had fun but I would have much
preferred doing it in person. After a few minor hiccups, Hopin worked
perfectly but it suffers the same problem as Zoom when your kids turn
off their cameras. I didn&amp;#39;t really feel connected to the audience,
Sure, there was the chat, but with the number of people in the
session, it flew by way to fast. We could have invited a few attendees
&amp;#34;up on stage&amp;#34; but that would have made the dual screen share
smaller. None of this was a deal breaker but the tech still has some
limitations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, sessions worked but had some pluses and minuses against in person
and the networking feature I described &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/virtual-conf/&#34;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; was a clear winner so
what&amp;#39;s next - the exhibits. Exhibits didn&amp;#39;t work for me. I can&amp;#39;t say
why. I think it&amp;#39;s because I like strolling the exhibit hall and just
chatting with both attendees and company reps. I generally don&amp;#39;t like
the formal booth talk and that&amp;#39;s all we got here. Nothing wrong with
the booth presentation but it&amp;#39;s just normally not my thing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other thing missing and it&amp;#39;s related to those exhibition hall
chats was the hallway track. That was the biggest loss. The informal
and semi-formal meetups. Impromptu lunches and dinners and one offs
that just happen. Can&amp;#39;t really have that with the current virtual
tools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final point was that when I go to a conference I get to both explore
a new part of the world and I get to turn off the outside world for a
couple of days - I can just enjoy the conference. You can&amp;#39;t do that if
it&amp;#39;s virtual but you get other advantages - no cost of travel and the
ability to attend at all your schedule doesn&amp;#39;t allow you to get away
for half a week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the verdict? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2020 edition of the CSTA conference was a big win in my book. I
hope we can do it in person next year but even if we can, it would be
great to offer at least parts virtually to make at least sessions
available to a wider audience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Either way, I&amp;#39;m there.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Conferences - CSTA 2020</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/virtual-conf/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 16:27:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/virtual-conf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be in NYC this week. I was supposed to be in
Arlington Virginia with around one thousand of my CS Teacher friends
at CSTA2020. Devorah was going to spend the days at the GitHub booth
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/blanket-statement-2020/&#34;&gt;teaching knitting&lt;/a&gt; and I was going to do a GitHub workshop and
generally enjoy the show
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course nobody&amp;#39;s traveling these days and CSTA2020 is running
remote. This is my second virtual conference as I attended parts of MongoDB
world a few weeks ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m still forming my opinion on CSTA2020 but I thought I&amp;#39;d share my
thoughts in progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To start, virtual conferences aren&amp;#39;t the same as in person - they
can&amp;#39;t be. For me, CSTA is a person first conference rather than
session first. That is, I get most of my value from the hallway
track. That&amp;#39;s not to say I don&amp;#39;t enjoy the sessions, it&amp;#39;s just that
for me personally, I get more from the chats than from the talks. By
contrast, for me SIGCSE is more about the sessions. There are a few
reasons why things fall this way but there neither here nor there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, since there can&amp;#39;t really be a hallway track, I was wondering how
CSTA2020 would feel. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR - it&amp;#39;s different but still pretty great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Keynote&amp;#39;s are keynotes wether virtual or in person so not much to say
in them so let&amp;#39;s move to the sessions. CSTA is using hopin.to and it&amp;#39;s
working pretty well. MongoDB used another platform that seemed to be
more glitchy. Hopin&amp;#39;s been working pretty seamlessly for me. I&amp;#39;m
presenting tomorrow so we&amp;#39;ll see if that changes my view. None of the
sessions I attended brought any participants &amp;#34;on stage&amp;#34; so
interactions were through the chat. It worked pretty well but at times
there was so much chatter that things flew off the screen before you
could read them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I&amp;#39;m digging the plaltform. Not the same as in person but it&amp;#39;s
a good approximation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The vendor / exhibit area worked pretty much the same way so not much
to say there. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall the interface is pretty smooth. Navigation could be smoother
and so could user search but overall, pretty nice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, where are we at? We&amp;#39;ve got a pretty good platform for sessions
with decent navigation, chat, and messaging but what about that
hallway track. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t have one but we have a pretty cool alternative. Hopin has a
networking feature. When you drop in, you&amp;#39;re matched with someone else
randomly for a 5 minute video chat. After five minutes, its over. You
can come back in and chat with someone else or be done with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really like this feature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For someone asocial and somewhat awkward like me, it&amp;#39;s great. Five
minutes isn&amp;#39;t too long to get awkward but it&amp;#39;s enough for a brief chat
and you can follow up later. The randomness lets you meet new people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some ways it&amp;#39;s better than in person. I frequently fly solo at
conferences. At this point I know a decent amount of people but when
at a new conference, it&amp;#39;s hard to break in. The reason is that many
colleges or schools send groups of teachers and they cluster together
making it hard for an individual to join in. I see it and fee it all
the time, With this platform, you&amp;#39;re dumped in one on one - no worries
about cliques. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&amp;#39;s the verdict. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m loving the networking feature and liking the overall tool. I hope
CSTA&amp;#39;s in person next year but I&amp;#39;ll be a happy attendee even if we
remain remote.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter&#39;s CS Teacher Certification program Week 2</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 10:31:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for some thoughts after week 2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this is the inaugural edition of our program and there was no
way to really know what the cohort would be like we&amp;#39;ve been adjusting
on the fly. This was expected but we&amp;#39;re finally starting to settle
in. We&amp;#39;re still finding more zoom heavy days but as we move towards
the end of our data structures segment there should be fewer of those.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cohort is progressing nicely. They&amp;#39;re working hard - we&amp;#39;ve got
some members who are former CS majors or otherwise came in with a
strong CS background but many were relative beginners. They&amp;#39;re all
coming along. We have to remind them that some topics just take
time. I&amp;#39;ve taught these subjects for years at Stuy but also at Hunter
College and NYU and recursion just takes time. So do Linked Lists and
dynamic data structures. It&amp;#39;s typical for CS majors not to be really
comfortable with them for a couple of years. I think I was near the
end of my college days before I&amp;#39;d roll out a pointer based solution to
a problem with the same comfort as with an array. So, the long and
short is that they&amp;#39;re doing great.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When we started, we tried to integrate a discussion of pedagogy with
the CS but found that we were expecting too much as the CS was new to
a large portion of the group. We decided instead to model assorted
teaching techniques but keep the analysis and discussion mostly to the
CS. Last Friday though we spent most of the morning looking back at
the pedagogy. It was a rich discussion. We loved that many of the
teachers commented on &amp;#34;when we modeled&amp;#34; one technique or another. We
ended up spending a good amount of time talking about scaffolding and
code skeletons, code reading and tracing, live coding and a bunch of
others. What was also cool was that some of the techniques we modeled
didn&amp;#39;t come up in our discussion originally (we had to interject them)
and some things we did unintentionally were also highlighted by the
cohort. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was a fun and productive morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another thing that came out of the discussion was our use of
technology but I&amp;#39;m saving that for another post. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I&amp;#39;m remembering that a month long summer intensive is, well,
intensive. It&amp;#39;s really draining. After Friday&amp;#39;s session was done and
JonAlf, Topher and I debriefed, I just crashed for the night and
pretty much took Saturday off save making one video that we&amp;#39;ll need on
Monday. It&amp;#39;s also hard on the students - 12 credits in one month. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, we&amp;#39;re chugging along and they&amp;#39;re doing great. More
confident than ever that we&amp;#39;re going to have a 21 new leaders in CS Ed
in NY come the program&amp;#39;s conclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reopening Schools - de Blasio and Carranza throw kids and teachers under the bus.</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 08:18:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/reopening-schools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza unveiled their open the
schools in the fall plan. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The plan is perfectly consistent with de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s
education policies and efforts in general - tone deaf, ineffective,
and in this case, unsafe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know we were told that part of this came from survey results but we
all know that surveys are super easy to fix. I mean, ask any teacher
or parent &amp;#34;do you want schools to be open and in person in the Fall?&amp;#34;
and everyone will say &amp;#34;yes.&amp;#34; Of course, there&amp;#39;s the implication that
it&amp;#39;s safe and I bet that part didn&amp;#39;t make it in to the surveys.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t watch the news conference live, but I was told that while
principals, parents, and children were mentioned over and over as
consulted constituents when forming the plan, somehow teachers never
came up. Typical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The basics of the plan is that students could go all remote or hybrid
and under the hybrid model, they&amp;#39;d be in the schools some days and not
others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does this address health concerns? Doubtful. They&amp;#39;re talking about a
third to half the students attending at a time. Take a look at any
school on opening and closing - it&amp;#39;s wall to wall from the school to
the subway. It&amp;#39;s a mess. Many schools are already split schedule -
they have their kids entry and egress staggered into halves or thirds
and the beginning and end of days there are &lt;strong&gt;STILL&lt;/strong&gt; wall to wall for
blocks not to mention the subway platforms and cars. Even 1/3 isn&amp;#39;t
going to do it and the more you stagger, the more you lengthen the
school days and this affects both staff and families. What good is
having a kid go to school so you can work if they don&amp;#39;t start until
mid day?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s assume, although I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption, that you
can get the kids to and from school safety. How big are the
classrooms? I heard that some Stuy teacher&amp;#39;s measured them and they
could safely accommodate something like 9 -  12 people. That&amp;#39;s in line
with what DbD said but what about transfer between classes? Some
schools - particularly those in converted spaces have TINY halls or
limited stairwells. What about bathrooms? None of this has been
addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about cleaning? Teachers have regularly begged for basic
supplies. Schools go without necessities like toilet paper and the
Mayor&amp;#39;s saying that we&amp;#39;ll have sufficient masks and cleaning supplies?
Good luck with that! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if we have the supplies, will they be used and used correctly and
often enough? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about compliance? For years, schools had a &amp;#34;no hats&amp;#34; policy but
rarely are there no hats. Even when the policy works, usually it&amp;#39;s a
result of teachers continually asking students to remove their
hats. How did those cell phone bans work? Do we really believe we can
get 100% compliance from students, teachers, and staff? What about the
younger grades? We really expect them to comply with adult
protocols?????
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if everything is implemented, will it keep everyone safe?
Unlikely. Professional and big time college sports have extreme
incentive to &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34;, boatloads of money and everyone pulling in the
same direction. They test all the time, have all the space they need
and can implement whatever protocols they want. Even with all this we
keep hearing about new cases in those populations. If they can&amp;#39;t do it
how can underfunded schools?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With all of this, even if it&amp;#39;s safe and even if schools can manage
reasonable schedules, students will only be going to school a couple
of times a week - will this really help parents? Maybe not. I remember
when we had Batya. We were looking for child care for just a couple of
days a week. Five days was easy, no days was easy but just a couple -
not so much. What about the shifted days? Large schools might need 4
shifts. Kids either start and end super early or super late. Will that
help parents who work &amp;#34;regular time&amp;#34; jobs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let&amp;#39;s get to the education side of things. High school
teachers teach five classes a day. Around 34 kids in a class. Given
room size restrictions that  means we have to split into threes. If
one teacher has to deal with this then it&amp;#39;s a HUGE increase in
work. If kids come to school on different days they&amp;#39;ll get different
live lessons - for each class teachers will have to make at least one
in person lesson and at least one corresponding remote lesson and I&amp;#39;m
over simplifying. Since you&amp;#39;re now &amp;#34;teaching&amp;#34; 10 or 15 classes instead
of 5 I don&amp;#39;t see how you can meet with them in person and deliver
synchronous remote instruction which means you&amp;#39;re only actually
interacting with your students once or twice a week and there&amp;#39;s no way
teachers will be able to actually develop materials, assess students,
and maintain meaningful contact unless someone finds a whole lot of
hours to the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, if the teacher just does the in person and another
or other teachers do the remote you&amp;#39;ll have multiple teachers teaching
a single class without any real coordination  - this is yet another
recipe for disaster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I get it - we all want to get back to normal. I want to be with my
students but I want to be with them safely. I also get that some
students are not doing well in isolation and that remote school is
both less effective than in person and a hardship all around but when
we open it has to make sense both in terms of safety and in terms of
education. de Blasio and Carranza&amp;#39;s plan is neither.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Productive Fidgeting at CSTA2020 - Build a Blanket for good</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/blanket-statement-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 15:49:30 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/blanket-statement-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/img/blanket2019.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s almost time for CSTA2020. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it but since
it&amp;#39;s going remote it is going to be interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since CSTA is, at least to me, very much a  &amp;#34;people conference&amp;#34; as
opposed to a &amp;#34;session conference&amp;#34; it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how it
all plays out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the things I was super excited about last year was Devorah&amp;#39;s
getting her &lt;a href=&#34;http://blanketstatementproject.com/&#34;&gt;Blanket Statement&lt;/a&gt; project off the ground. The whole idea
was to have knitters and crocheters make squares while attending
conference sessions instead of incessantly checking their
phones. Productive fidgeting she calls it. At the end, Devorah put the
squares together into a blanket and it was donated to a child in need.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Finished! 44 / 49 blocks crafted by CSTA participants. Thank you &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GitHubEducation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@GitHubEducation&lt;/a&gt; for hosting, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csteachersorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@csteachersorg&lt;/a&gt; for allowing and promoting and to all who participated whether I have your handle / name or not! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/akohart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@akohart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Sputtnikme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@sputtnikme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RebekahCLang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@RebekahCLang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TweetsInShadow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@TweetsInShadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karmaturner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@Karmaturner&lt;/a&gt; ... &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/96XzrVRcCG&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/96XzrVRcCG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BlanketStatement (@BlanketStmtProj) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BlanketStmtProj/status/1150878754916450304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was really cool. Our friends at GitHub Education provided space at
their booth where Devorah could teach knitters or people could stop by
on a break to make a square or two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was really cool.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we can&amp;#39;t do it again in person we can do it remotely. So, if you
knit or crochet, pick up those needles or hooks while you&amp;#39;re watching
those sessions and knit some squares. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can &lt;del&gt;email&lt;/del&gt; mail  your squares to Devorah and she&amp;#39;ll put them all together
into a blanket or you can donate them locally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can find more details at &lt;a href=&#34;http://blanketstatementproject.com&#34;&gt;http://blanketstatementproject.com&lt;/a&gt; or
email Devorah at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mailto:blanketstatementproject@gmail.com&#34;&gt;blanketstatementproject@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hope to see many friends at CSTA2020 and hope many do some productive
fidgeting to crowdsource a blanket for a chile in need.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hunter&#39;s CS Teacher Certification program  Week 1</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:48:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teacher-cert-week-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Time for an update on our NY State Teacher Certification Program. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We kicked off on Monday. Twenty two students working with three
instructors from 9:00 - 3:00 every day. We&amp;#39;ve been using a combination
of synchronous with Zoom and async using Slack and GitHub
discussions. We&amp;#39;re using GitHub as our main platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Day 0 was very Zoom heavy but we&amp;#39;re trying to balance one big Zoom
session a day combined with other work so as to minimize fatigue. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Due to our time constraints we had some prework before we officially
started. We had to debrief on that at the start and then also had to
deliver new instruction and all that made for a rough first day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Things got better in day 1. We were able to do one zoom session in the
morning to set the stage on 2D arrays and were able to work more
independently with slack support in the afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On Day 2 I finally got to teach as I had been running a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/&#34;&gt;Computational
Thinking&lt;/a&gt; workshop during days 0 and 1. I led the morning session on
Conway&amp;#39;s Game of Life which led to a coding project in the afternoon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today we flipped the script doing self directed work in the morning
and then got together to go over objects and classes in the afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there&amp;#39;s more to tweak I&amp;#39;m very happy with how things are
going. We have a great cohort. In addition to supporting each other in
class they&amp;#39;ve started to organize their own study groups and sessions
both off hours and during our independant work. I haven&amp;#39;t said
anything about this nor have I intruded as I think it&amp;#39;s healthy for
the cohort to have their own self directed space. I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s
happening without me having to prod behind the scenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I&amp;#39;m very happy with how it&amp;#39;s gone so far there are some areas of
concern. Since this is a new program with an unknown cohort we&amp;#39;re
figuring out a lot on the fly. We&amp;#39;re doing better on the format and
pacing of activities but I feel we can still do better. With this in
mind we&amp;#39;re all having an online discussion throughout the weekend
about how to adjust and by we I mean the entire cohort and all the
instructors. If you&amp;#39;ve got a cohort of 22 experienced teachers you&amp;#39;re
foolish not to exploit their expertise. I&amp;#39;m also a little concerned
about the methods component. We&amp;#39;re already integrating some things -
live coding and subgoal labeling for example but some of the methods I
wanted to cover just don&amp;#39;t fit well in a remote model and we also have
to be careful about not overloading the teachers while many are just
learning the CS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next week we&amp;#39;ll start getting into data structures. We&amp;#39;ve got four
more weeks but we&amp;#39;re well on our way.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching CS  - all the educators to all the grades</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 12:29:06 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teaching-cs-in-all-the-grades/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m kicking off a couple of exciting summer projects next week and
it&amp;#39;s been pointed out to me a couple of times that I&amp;#39;ll be working
with educators at every level to help them to deliver CS instruction
to students at every level. What an opportunity to be a part of and
learn from - working with every level of teacher for every level of
student. I&amp;#39;m part of the teaching teams but I think I&amp;#39;m also going to
learn a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, how is this happening? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One project I&amp;#39;m working on, entering its second year is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/ct-in-primary-grades/&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; on
computational thinking in the early grades. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yadavaman&#34;&gt;Aman Yadav&lt;/a&gt; and I, with the
support of the Robin Hood Foundation will be working with primary
grade teachers to develop experience that both teach computational
thinking and use CT to support the core subject areas. As we had last
time, we&amp;#39;ll have both working teachers and pre-service teachers - that
is, Hunter students close to earning their teaching degrees and
certifications. In the Fall, the pre-service teachers will student
teach under the supervision of the working teachers in our
program. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based on what we did last year I&amp;#39;m convinced that this years cohort
will get a lot out of the experience but I&amp;#39;m also convinced that the
workshop still faces the limitations of any professional development
style training - short duration, one shot, and no long term
support. PD can be valuable but I&amp;#39;m 100% convinced it&amp;#39;s not the answer
in terms of preparing CS teachers. At the end of the workshop, our
teachers will have learned something about CT, be more comfortable
with it, and have designed some lessons that they&amp;#39;ll deliver in the
Fall. It&amp;#39;s a start but it&amp;#39;s not the end. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The game changer brings me to the other group of people
participating - four full time Hunter Faculty members. They all teach
in our School of Education. The aim is to see where we can add CT to
our pre-service classes. This moves the needle. If we do it right,
soon enough, every Hunter College primary grade teaching candidate
will be learning about Computational Thinking in their required Ed
classes. That&amp;#39;s how you do it - get it into pre-service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that has me working with pre-service and in-service teachers as
well as full time research faculty. That&amp;#39;s a lot of levels of
educators but it&amp;#39;s not all the grades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&amp;#39;s the other project we&amp;#39;re kicking off on Monday and one that I
plan to write a lot about over the next month and into next year. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&amp;#39;re finally kicking off our Computer Science Teacher certification
program. We&amp;#39;ve got a cohort of a little over 20 teachers that will
take part in a month long intensive followed by more coursework in
the Fall. When they&amp;#39;re done, they&amp;#39;ll be among the first certified
computer science teachers in New York State. The cohort consists
mostly of High School teachers but we&amp;#39;ve got some middle school in
there as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This too is a game changer. We&amp;#39;re not giving a curriculum to follow or
scripts to copy but rather we&amp;#39;re teaching serious CS and how to teach
it. Of course it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that the cohort is comprised of strong,
experienced teachers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So there it is - all the levels of teachers to all the levels of
students. I&amp;#39;m super excited to be part of both of these game changing
projects and can&amp;#39;t wait for Monday when we get to work.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why are police held to such a lower standard than teachers?</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 12:36:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/teachers-police-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My friend Neal Zupancic, actually former student, friend, and long
time teacher Neal Zupancic posted this on Facebook. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s 100% spot on. I&amp;#39;d add my two cents but Neal captured it better
than I ever could. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take a minute to read it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my ten years of teaching, I&amp;#39;ve dealt with a number of situations
that could have potentially turned dangerous.  I&amp;#39;ve taught in public
schools and private; urban schools and rural.  I have de-escalated
every last one of those situations.  I have never once used force.  I
once broke up a fist fight using only my voice and my presence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never felt the need to announce that before, because it&amp;#39;s just a
part of my profession.  Every teacher knows it and most of the public
knows as well.  And there are teachers who have been in far more
dangerous situations than I have.  Teachers who deal with gang
activity, drug dealers, kids who bring weapons to school with the
intent to use them, kids who fight and don&amp;#39;t necessarily stop when you
show up.  I know teachers who have been assaulted by students.  I know
teachers who have been threatened by students, including with deadly
weapons.  Every teacher is expected to deal with every one of these
situations without using force or violence.  Some of us are
well-trained, and some of us are thrown in and just go on instinct.
But we de-escalate.  We calm.  We soothe.  We help.  We repair and
restore the community.  We heal people.  We build an environment in
which those we are responsible for can thrive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I keep seeing people ask &amp;#34;who would want to be a cop if you could get
fired for doing your job?&amp;#34;  But literally any teacher could do that
job without killing people.  Literally any teacher would have had the
patience to talk George Floyd into getting into that police car
instead of tossing him on the ground and murdering him.  Literally any
teacher would have let Rayshard Brooks get away rather than shooting
him dead, knowing that the system would provide accountability for his
resisting arrest and that you didn&amp;#39;t have to be his executioner.
Literally any teacher knows that by the time you are in a power
struggle with a student, you have already lost.
Literally. any. teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hear these cops whining on social media and it sickens me.  They
wouldn&amp;#39;t last a day teaching.  And of course we see that when we see
how often cops in schools arrest kids for routine behavior problems
that teachers could have solved peacefully.  We already know cops
can&amp;#39;t handle teenagers without resorting to force.  We already know
cops in schools exacerbate racism and inequality - just like they do
outside of schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the reason for that is that we fire teachers who can&amp;#39;t control
their tempers.  We fire teachers who use force rather than let them
stay on the job and keep escalating that force until they kill
someone.  We &lt;strong&gt;weed out&lt;/strong&gt; the bad apples.  And no teacher would ever
dream of protesting or walking off the job in support of someone who
got fired for assaulting a student.  Are you kidding me?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m reading posts in teacher&amp;#39;s groups about going back to school in
fall - or in some cases, in July or August to extend the school year -
without adequate protection from coronavirus, without enough room in
their halls and classrooms to socially distance, without funding for
hand sanitizer or wipes or masks, without training or PD on blended or
distance learning, without promised raises because municipalities have
lost tax revenue because of corona - and then I see cops who walk
around in body armor and work for departments that own tanks, whining
about how hard their jobs are because they&amp;#39;re finally catching flak
for shooting people, and it&amp;#39;s like - what are your priorities?  Where
is your perspective?  What kind of society do you expect to raise into
the next generation when you&amp;#39;ll fund a militarized occupying force
with impunity for homicide but you won&amp;#39;t buy teachers masks and
sanitizer during a pandemic?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And teachers never, ever, ever whine like these cops do.  My
&lt;strong&gt;students&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#39;t even whine like these cops do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seriously - where do they find these people?  Our job is a hundred
times harder and if we mess up even once the way cops do every day,
we&amp;#39;re out in a heartbeat.  And yet if I whined about it the way cops
whine about it, people would say &amp;#34;hey man, maybe you should stfu and
find a different job.&amp;#34;  And they&amp;#39;d be right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So to all the cops out there who think they have it rough: You ain&amp;#39;t
nothing compared to a teacher.  STFU and find a different job.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PSA on CSTA (NYC)</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/psa-for-csta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just a quick public service announcemnt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Up until now CSTA-NYC has been using Meetup to organize and advertise
events but now they&amp;#39;re moving over to using the CSTA site as their
platform. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re a CS teacher you should be a part of CSTA. There&amp;#39;s both a
free tier and a plus tier which costs $50 a year.  I&amp;#39;ve been a plus
member since that level became available. If you&amp;#39;re a NYC teacher, you
should join the CSTA NYC chapter. If you&amp;#39;re already coming to CSTA-NYC
events, you should still go to the CSTA web site and check to make
sure you&amp;#39;re part of the NYC chapter so that you don&amp;#39;t miss any
exciting announcements or events. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Read the tweet below for instructions:

      <title>A new book on teaching CS in K12 - and I wrote a chapter!!</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/in-a-book/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:08:12 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/in-a-book/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I was involved in a really exciting project a few months ago and now
that it&amp;#39;s available, it&amp;#39;s time to tell everyone about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a new book on teaching CS in K12 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/&#34;&gt;Computer Science in K12&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I got an email a few months ago from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/shuchig&#34;&gt;Shuchi Grover&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, actually a
DM over twitter. I hadn&amp;#39;t officially met Shuchi although I&amp;#39;m pretty
sure we&amp;#39;ve been at the same table or group in a conference or two but
I did know her from reputation. Shuchi was putting together a book on
teaching CS in K12 and asked if I was interested in contributing a
chapter. I was flattered and honored and since I&amp;#39;ve never written a
chapter in a book I agreed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book&amp;#39;s made up of 26 chapters with a who&amp;#39;s who of authors
including teachers, professors, researchers, and other CS Ed adjacent
professionals. Check out the full &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/authors/&#34;&gt;cast of characters&lt;/a&gt;. It was cool to
see many friends involved in the project. It should be a welcome
addition since I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything like in currently out. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t read the full book - I&amp;#39;m anxiously awaiting my copy to
arrive but with chapter titles ranging from concepts like &amp;#34;Data Structures&amp;#34; and
&amp;#34;Repetition and Recursion&amp;#34; to techniques like &amp;#34;Questions and Inquiry&amp;#34;
and &amp;#34;Guided Exploration Through Unplugged Activities&amp;#34; it should be a
really valuable resource to teachers rather than just a book to use in
a class and keep on the shelf.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I worked on the chapter on functions. Once again I was paired with my
long time partner in crime JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver. Jens Monig, whom I
hadn&amp;#39;t known prior also worked on the chapter contributing the drag
and drop material - something that neither JonAlf nor I felt
particularly comfortable with doing ourselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One weird thing, though it makes sense, was that I never interacted
with most of the other authors - just my chapter co-authors and
Shuchi. Nothing wrong with it but given the number of friends working
on the book and a chance to meet new friends it would have been great
to have something like a meetup at SIGCSE had it happened. On the
other hand, working with Shuchi was terrific. This not only gave me a
chance to contribute to a book but it also got us together and now I
look forward to future collaborations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other big take away for me was that writing the chapter was
fun. I&amp;#39;ve been playing with the idea of writing a book on teaching CS
but wasn&amp;#39;t sure I&amp;#39;d enjoy the process. Now I think I might and I might
get started in August when I think I&amp;#39;ll finally have some project
time. What do all of you think? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For now, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shuchigrover.com/atozk12cs/&#34;&gt;Computer Science in K-12&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just released on Amazon in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-K-12-Z-Programming/dp/1734662700/&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1734662719/&#34;&gt;Black and White&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Using Emacs 73 - Ripgrep and updating the blog</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-rg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 11:58:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-rg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
As I said in my &lt;a href=&#34;As I mentioned in my &#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;m moving to a new Hugo theme. I decided
on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis&#34;&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s simple and clean. Unfortunately, in this change over,
many things broke. Specifically, all my embedded html. Using earlier
version of Hugo I could directly embed HTML and it would render. Now I
have to bracket the HTML with special org markup - &lt;strong&gt;#+begin_export html&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;#+end_export html&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;example&#34;&gt;
#+begin_export html
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;html stuff to render goes in here &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
#+end_export
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Minimally I had to find all my embedded videos and all my embedded
Tweets. There&amp;#39;s probably a lot more. Fortunately with Emacs this is
pretty easy. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dajva/rg.el&#34;&gt;rg.el&lt;/a&gt; which is an Emacs front end to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep&#34;&gt;ripgrep&lt;/a&gt;. If
you don&amp;#39;t know ripgrep, it&amp;#39;s kind of like a super fast, super enhanced grep on
steroids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Emacs, I was able to do a ripgrep search which created a buffer
containing all the embedded html fragments from all my blog posts
across all the directories. I then used Emacs&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep&#34;&gt;wgrep&lt;/a&gt; feature which
allowed me to edit that combined buffer and save all the results back
to the original files. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All in all it just took a few minutes. There are still some things I
have to clean up from older posts but at least the site is workable now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out the video for a walkthrough:
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time For A New Theme</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/time-for-a-new-theme/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 09:03:05 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/time-for-a-new-theme/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
While setting up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook-update/&#34;&gt;Pinebook Pro&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to make sure I could write
blog posts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; installed and ran no problem but I switched to
Hugo in April 2020 back when it was version .49 or something like
that. Now it&amp;#39;s up to .73. It turns out there have been a few
changes. First, I set up my blog with two directories for posts. One
for the posts I wrote originally in Jekyll and one for the ones I
wrote for Hugo. I had to make a few changes to get that to work with
the new version.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also discovered that my archive page no longer works under the
current version of Hugo. As I poked around a little more, it turns out
that HTML embedding changed so I&amp;#39;m going to have to tweak all my Emacs
posts as well as posts where I embed tweets or other content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All of this is to say that some or maybe many of my older posts will
be wonky until I can get around to fixing them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than figuring out how to fix them under my current blog theme I
figured it was also a good time to explore a new Hugo theme so don&amp;#39;t
be surprised if the overall look here changes a few times over the
next few posts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll be able to get everything working again sooner rather
than later.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supporting Our Students</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 12:22:26 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/supporting-our-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Austin Cory Bart put together a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://acbart.github.io//2020/06/10/race-in-cs1/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about supporting Black
students in CS1. Cory asked about this on the SIGCSE mailing list and
in his post he both breaks things down and shares all the resources
that he compiled from the ensuing discussion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a lot of good stuff both in the post and in the links but
there&amp;#39;s a lot to get lost in. As teachers we can sometimes affect
change at a department or school level but we can always make a
difference in our classes and with our students.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I titled this post &amp;#34;Supporting Our Students&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Supporting Black
Students.&amp;#34; I&amp;#39;m certainly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; pulling any all lives matter BS but
rather reflecting back on something that shaped my approach with my
students and started to open my eyes and that specific experience for
me was an all students experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I cut my teach at Seward Park High School down on the Lower East
Side. It was a high poverty school and a very diverse one. I had
top flight honors students, criminal thugs, druggies, sweet kids whom
the system failed and everything else you can imagine. The main groups
were classified back then as Chinese and Hispanic and then Black then
White but within those groups there were subdivisions. Shortly before
I got the gig the school had brokered an in school truce between the
factions of Chinese gangs and while the term of the day was
Hispanic the students were from a variety of places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One day I was talking to a guidance counselor in the hall. We didn&amp;#39;t
know each other - I shanghaied her in another conversation - I had
something to ask. She said &amp;#34;wait - you&amp;#39;re Zamansky right?&amp;#34; Yep. &amp;#34;I was
wondering who you were, all the students want to be in your class.&amp;#34; I
was confused. I wasn&amp;#39;t super popular - I was just in about a year and
a half. I also wasn&amp;#39;t so good. I&amp;#39;d rate myself as an above average
very raw young teacher but that&amp;#39;s about it. She explained that I was
one of the only teachers where students from all the population groups
wanted to be in my class. The Hispanic students, for instance all
wanted to be in Pablo Chang&amp;#39;s math class, the Chinese in another
teachers but apparently I appealed to everyone equally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I started to think about why that might be the case and it got me
thinking about what I had learned in my short time teaching. Prior to
teaching I led a pretty sheltered life. I went to public school up
until college and had a pretty diverse group of friends but as a kid
you can be pretty oblivious to economic and race related
differences. As an adult I went to a private college, NYU, and started off
at Goldman Sachs. Not exactly a recipe for awareness. I quickly
realized that not all kids learned the same, thought the same and
going further, lived the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It taught me that it&amp;#39;s not merely about talking to your students, it&amp;#39;s
about listening to them. Given time and the chance, they&amp;#39;ll open up
and you&amp;#39;ll learn about their challenges. When it seems there giving
you a song and dance, don&amp;#39;t assume they&amp;#39;re trying to pull a fast
one. Give them the benefit of the doubt. You&amp;#39;ll get burned now and
again by a kid taking advantage but things have a way of coming clean
and if you don&amp;#39;t give the kid the benefit of the doubt you can
irreparably harm your relationship. Trust is key in
education.  Besides I&amp;#39;ve been burned way more by giving the benefit of
the doubt to people professionally than as a teacher and at the end of
the day I&amp;#39;d rather lose sleep angry over being taken advantage of than
lose sleep feeling guilty for damaging my relationship with a student
for the wrong reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you treat your students like people - young people but  people
nonetheless and earnestly listen and try to learn from them and learn
about them that&amp;#39;s your guide. I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m particularly good at
helping my kids - I&amp;#39;m your stereotypical socially awkward computer
geek but the more I listened the more I understood the individual
issues my students had to deal with. My Black students, my immigrant
students, my poor students and all the rest. Sure there were common
themes but every one has a unique story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we teach our assorted subjects to our students really at the end
of the day more so than teaching any specific computer science I hope
to be a force for good in their lives and their development as
people. The best way I can do that is to listen, try to learn, try to
understand and then try to help and support.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Quick Pinebook Pro update</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook-update/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Since posting about my new &lt;a href=&#34;https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook/&#34;&gt;Pinebook Pro&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve gotten a few questions as
it pertains to teaching CS so I thought I&amp;#39;d give a quick update.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of software here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve actually gotten working: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
libreoffice (comes preinstalled)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C/C++ toolchain (manjaro package install)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Java (manjaro package install)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emacs (built from scratch and manjaro install)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
NetLogo (had to customize the startup script as per the NetLogo
FAQ)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Racket (had to compile from source)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve also heard the VSCode works with no issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&amp;#39;s also manjaro which is a little different from Ubuntu which is
probably more well known. I installed a program named &lt;a href=&#34;https://computingforgeeks.com/yay-best-aur-helper-for-arch-linux-manjaro/&#34;&gt;yay&lt;/a&gt; for
package management which also gave me access to the community packages
(like extra repos for Ubuntu). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest difference I&amp;#39;ve had between Manjaro and Ubuntu is with
Ubuntu I&amp;#39;d search for packages with &lt;code&gt;apt-cache search package&lt;/code&gt; and
install with &lt;code&gt;apt-get install package&lt;/code&gt; while with yay it&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;yay -Ss
package&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;yay -S package&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a little more nuanced but it
isn&amp;#39;t harder, just different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The other difference is that the Pinebook is set up with Manjaro
running KDE plasma which is a different interface but all common
windowing interfaces are fairly similar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A final point I want to mention is that the Pinebook Pro price of
$200 represents the cost of the unit. The Pine64 people don&amp;#39;t make any
money on this. It&amp;#39;s about getting the units out there and building a
community. First, this means that you won&amp;#39;t be able to go online and
order class sets of these (at least I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;d be able to do
so) and that if a device such as this were made by a tradional vendor
it would cost at least a bit more so that they could make a hopefully
fair profit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, this is a very functional Linux laptop for around $200. It
proves what you can do and After a few days use I highly recommend it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
$200
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pinebook Pro - an $200 Linux Laptop</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 17:24:57 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/pinebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;m writing this on my new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/&#34;&gt;Pinebook Pro&lt;/a&gt; - a $200 ARM based Linux
laptop. The Pinebook Pro comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/&#34;&gt;Pine64&lt;/a&gt; project. As you could
figure out, they do the Pine64 which is similar to a Raspberry Pi and
they&amp;#39;ve got some cool projects. In addition to the Pinebook pro
they&amp;#39;ve also got the Pine Tab and Pine Phone and more. Now, you&amp;#39;re not
going to be able to go to their site and say &amp;#34;I need 30 of these for
my class&amp;#34; - at least not for the Pinebook pro but it is a pretty cool
proof of concept and hobbyist machine and it shows that we could have
affordable devices for our schools and less afluent students. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I got the PbP out of curiousity and also to see if I could find a low
cost solution for Hunter College students. All of my honors students
get laptops but the rest of Hunter CS is on their own so a low cost
device is pretty attractive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The specs are pretty decent - 1080P 14&amp;#34; screen, 4GB of memory, 64GB
mmc (upgradeable), USB-C, long battery life and more. They claim that
it can drive an external 4k monitor but I haven&amp;#39;t tested this yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, does it deliver?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall yes but with a few caveats. It&amp;#39;s still on the side of a
tinkerer/hobbyist device.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Out of the box it seemed DOA - it wouldn&amp;#39;t boot. I found in the forums
that there&amp;#39;s an emmc enable switch inside that sometimes ended up in
the off position. I had to take out the eight screws from the bottom,
pop the case and flip the switch. Seems like that&amp;#39;s something that
could have been caught before they closed the cases but it wasn&amp;#39;t too
big of a deal. It is, however a deal breaker for a novice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From there it booted fine. Right into Manjaro Linux running
KDE. Everything seemed to work. Next I tried to boot of an SD card -
Debian this time. Worked like a charm though the distribution kept
dropping WIFI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to Manjaro. Being a Linuxmint user and having not used Manjaro in
about two years it took a bit of time to get the lay of the land but
just about everything worked. I installed syncthing which I use
instead of dropbox, zsh, and built Emacs from source. It took forever
but worked. Well, worked with some font problems. I ended up installing
Emacs 27 from the Manjaro repositories and everything went
seemelessly. Even though I ended up not using the source built Emacs
it did show that the G++ toolchain all worked well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also tested Java and Clojure. No problems though starting Clojure
seemed to take a day and a half. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other tests included installing the Cinnamon and Mate desktop
environments. The only thing I haven&amp;#39;t been able to install
succesfully has been a VPN. On the battery front, I haven&amp;#39;t used it
long enough in a sitting to put a dent in it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, at $200, this isn&amp;#39;t going to be a speed demon. My default config
does a bunch of things so even opening a terminal with zsh has some
lag. Once loaded though things are smooth. I would have loved more
memory but 4GB seems sufficient for day to day stuff and student work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Will his become my day to day laptop? I don&amp;#39;t know. I think if I can
slim down some of my config it might.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re looking for an innexpensive Linux laptop and are comfortable
tinkering and reading some forums check out the Pinebook. If it was an
option, I&amp;#39;d love to get these for my students instead of the
overpriced Dells we have to get them every year.
&lt;/p&gt;
