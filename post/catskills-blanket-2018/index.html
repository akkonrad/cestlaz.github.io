Two weekends ago I took a group of my first year students up to
<a href="http://catskillsconf.com">Catskills Conf</a>, an annual event that I describe as &#34;light tech
conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion meets summer camp.&#34;
I&#39;ve <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/catskills-2017/">written about</a> the event before if anyone&#39;s interested in more
details. As in past years, Devorah ran her <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/knitting-tech-conference/">knitting for good</a>

Catskills Conf learned how to know and collectively knit, crocheted

blankets to children in crisis.

This year we made two:

While I was off this morning <a href="https://twitter.com/diane_levitt/status/1056560530956214272">talking</a> to high school students at
Cornell Technion, Devorah was finishing off the blankets and
delivering them.
</p>
<p>
In past years, the blanket was usually mostly made by a small handful
of experienced knitters who attended the conference. This year was
very different. For the first time, many of my students took part in
the project.

<p>
A few already knew how to know but more were learning for the first
time.
</p>
<p>
I love that were at a tech conference and at the same time learning to
be creative with our hands and all the while doing some good for
others.
</p>
<p>
Already looking forward to next year.
